[Verse 1]
B                                F#
I thought that we had something good in our hands
G#m
In a minute it just slipped away
C#m
so many things I didn't say
F#
Before you threw it all away
B
I pretend I'm okay
F#
But I'm lost and afraid
     G#m
And nobody really understands
C#m
But now I'm dancing to a band
F#
With all the demons in my head


[Chorus]
E                       F#
Call me when he breaks your heart next summer
B                   E
Baby, I'll be waiting here
E                      F#
Call me when you're all fucked up, my lover
B                          E
I'll be there to lick your tears
                           F#
You had to throw away our love
              D#m
To find out nothing's as good as us
E                               F#               B
So call me when he breaks your heart next summer


[Verse 2]
B
If you love, let it go
        F#
It's a saying that I heard
       G#m
But I don't know if it works for me
C#m
So if I see you on my street
         F#
I know that it was meant to be
B
Do you still think of me
         F#
When you're under the sheets
      G#m
Or does he give you everything
C#m
And I can see it on your face
     F#
That you were happier with me


[Chorus]
E                       F#
So call me when he breaks your heart next summer
B                   E
Baby, I'll be waiting here
E                      F#
Call me when you're all fucked up, my lover
B                          E
I'll be there to lick your tears
                           F#
You had to throw away our love
              D#m
To find out nothing's as good as us
E                               F#               C#m
So call me when he breaks your heart next summer


[Bridge]
C#m                        G#m
For everything under the sun
       F#
Every girl and every drug
C#m                      G#m
It's never gonna be enough
         F#m
'Cause you're the one


[Chorus]
E                       F#
Call me when he breaks your heart next summer
B                   E
Baby, I'll be waiting here
E                      F#
Call me when you're all fucked up, my lover
B                          E
I'll be there to lick your tears
                           F#
But since you threw away our love
              D#m
Then maybe something's as good as us
E                               F#               B
I really hope he breaks your heart next summer
