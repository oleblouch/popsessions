[Intro]

Dm7  D7sus2  G     x2


[Verse 1]

Am7                    Bm7
How can I just let you walk away
             C               Dm7
Just let you leave without a trace,
       F                 G/F               Em7  Am
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh.
           Dm           F                 Gsus4 G 
You're the only one who really knew me at all.
Am7                    Bm7
How can you just walk away from me,
         C                     Dm7
When all I can do is watch you leave,
            F                   G
Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain,
    Em7             Am
And even shared the tears.
           Dm           F                 Gsus4 G
You're the only one who really knew me at all.


[Chorus]
                     C/G
So take a look at me now
                      D/G
Cause there's just an empty space,
            Am                   F
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
         Dm             Gsus4 
Just the memory of your face.
          G          C/G
Oh take a look at me now
                      D/G
Cause there's just an empty space,
               Am             F
And you coming back to me is against the odds,
           Dm               Gsus4  G
And that's what I've got to face.


[Verse 2]
  Am7                         Bm7
I wish I could just make you turn around,
C                      Dm7
Turn around and see me cry,
           F              G/F
There's so much I need to say to you,
   Em7          Am
So many reasons why.
           Dm           F                 Gsus4       G
You're the only one who really knew me at all.


[Chorus]
                     C/G
So take a look at me now
                      D/G
Cause there's just an empty space,
            Am                     F
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
         Dm             Gsus4
Just the memory of your face.
          G          C/G
Oh take a look at me now
                      D/G
Cause there's just an empty space,
       Am                        F
But to wait for you, well that's all I can do,
           Dm               Gsus4
And that's what I've got to face.
            G          C/G
Take a good look at me now
                    D/G
Cause I'll still be standing here,
               Am             F
And you coming back to me is against all odds,
         Dm                 Gsus4       G
It's the chance I've got to take


[Outro]
Dm7  D7sus2  G     x2

                  Dm7  C  G  F  G
Take a look at me now.
