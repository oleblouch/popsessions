[Intro]

| C     |       | Am    |       |

| Dm    |       | Gsus4 | G     |


[Verse 1]
         C
If you believe in the power of magic,
Am
I can change your mind
           Dm
And if you need to believe in someone,
Gsus4           G
Turn and look behind
             C
When we were   living in a dream world,
Am
Clouds got in the way
           Dm
We gave it up in a moment of madness
Gsus4         G
Threw it all away


[Chorus]
      C
Don't answer me, don't break the silence
Em
Don't let me win
      C
Don't answer me, stay on your island
Fsus2        F
Don't let me in
Ab/Bb        Bb             C
Run away and hide from everyone
Ab/Bb              Bb                    C
Can you change the things we've said and done?


[Verse 2]
         C
If you believe in the power of magic,
     Am
It's all a fantasy
          Dm
So if you need to believe in someone,
Gsus4             G
Just pretend it's me
          C
It ain't enough that we meet as strangers
Am
I can't set you free
        Dm
So will you turn your back forever
Gsus4               G
On what you mean to me?


[Chorus]
      C
Don't answer me, don't break the silence
Em
Don't let me win
      C
Don't answer me, stay on your island
Fsus2        F
Don't let me in
Ab/Bb        Bb             C
Run away and hide from everyone
Ab/Bb              Bb                    C
Can you change the things we've said and done?

[Chorus]
       C
Don't answer me, don't break the silence
Em
Don't let me win
      C
Don't answer me, stay on your island
Fsus2        F
Don't let me in
Ab/Bb        Bb              C
Run away and hide from everyone

       C
Don't answer me, don't break the silence
Em
Don't let me win
      C
Don't answer me, stay on your island
Fsus2        F
Don't let me in
Ab/Bb              Bb                    C
Can you change the things we've said and done?
