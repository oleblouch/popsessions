[Verse]
C       G            Am       F (*)
  Everybody's got to live together
C         G             Am      F
  All the people got to understand
C                G                  Am        F
  So, love your neighbour like you love your brother
G
  Come on and join the band
                (*)-&gt; The bass goes like C[/ch]-[ch]D[/ch]-[ch]E[/ch]-[ch]F, so you could
                      play C - G/D - Am/E - F, if you want to....

[Verse]
Well, all you need is love and understanding
Ring the bell and let the people know
We're so happy and we're celebratin'
Come on and let your feelings show

[Chorus] (Not really a chorus because the text changes every time...)
        Am                 D
Love is all, well love is all,
        G(**)                    C
Love is all, can't you hear the call
        Am        (Am/G ***)
Oh, love is all you need
        D[/ch](/[ch]F# ***) G                  C
Love is all you need at the Butterfly Ball

INTRO again

[Verse]
Ain't you happy that we're all together
At the ball in nature's countryside
And although we're wearing different faces
Nobody wants to hide

[Chorus] (Not really a chorus because the text changes every time...)
        Am                 D
Love is all, well love is all,
        G(**)                    C
Love is all, can't you hear the call
        Am        (Am/G ***)
Oh, love is all you need
        D[/ch](/[ch]F# ***) G                  C
Love is all you need at the Butterfly Ball

Now comes a little waltz-like intermezzo; i really dont know how you should play it,
but the chords are like the intro, so you can play the intro or freak away if you want to!

[Verse]
All you need is love and understanding
Hey, ring the bell and let the people know
We're so happy and we're celebratin'
Let your feelings show

[Chorus] (Not really a chorus because the text changes every time...)
        Am                 D
Love is all, well love is all,
        G(**)                    C
Love is all, can't you hear the call
        Am        (Am/G ***)
Oh, love is all you need
        D[/ch](/[ch]F# ***) G                  C
Love is all you need at the Butterfly Ball

[Outro]
When you back's to the wall
When you're starting to fall
You got something to lean on
Love is everything
It can make you sing at the Butterfly Ball
Love is all, I say love is all, yes love is all
At the Butterfly Ball

(the song fades out, but you can make up a nice ending i think)
