[Verse]
D               F#m
Oh, why look so sad
                  G
Tears are in your eyes
                    D/A A A/C#
Come on and come to me  now
D     Bm            F#m
Don't be ashamed to cry
               G
Let me see you through
                    Bm        A
Cause I've seen the dark side too


[Bridge]
F#m                  Bm
When the night falls on you
F#m                Bm
Don't know what to do
               G
Nothing you confess 
                       A
Could make me love you less


[Chorus]
              D                  Bm7
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you

[Verse]
C               Em
So if you're mad get mad

Don't hold it all inside
                    C/G G/B      
Come on and talk to me  now
    C    Am              Em
And hey, what you got to hide
            F
I get angry too
           Am       G
Well I'm a lot like you

[Bridge]
            Em              Am
When you're standing at the crossroads
      Em                 Am
Don't know which path to choose
             F(add9)
Let me come along
                     Gsus4
Cause even if you're wrong

Won't let nobody hurt you

I'll stand by you
                   Bm7
Baby, even to your darkest hour
                 Am7
And I'll never desert you,

You're feeling all alone, you won't be on your own
