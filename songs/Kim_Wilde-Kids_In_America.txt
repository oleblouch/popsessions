Verse 1

A
Looking out a dirty old window
                                   G 
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
  F         G          D
I sit here alone and I wonder why.


Verse 2

A
Friday night and everyone's moving

I can feel the heat but it's soothing
G           
Heading down, 
  F              G            D
I search for the beat in this dirty town.

Down town the young ones are growing

We're the kids in America, (Woh–oh)
F          G                     A
 Everybody live for the music-go-round.


Verse 3

A
Bright lights the music gets faster
                                          G
Look boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
    F           G          D
I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance.


Verse 4

A
Hot-shot, give me no problems
                                 G
Much later baby you'll be saying never mind
    F            G              D
You know life is cruel, life is never kind.

We're the kids in America, (Woh–oh)
