[Intro]
F    Am    x2

[Verse 1]
     F
I was  bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
     Am
I was  unrecognizable to myself
      F
Saw my  reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
          Am
Oh brother, are you gonna leave me wasting away on the
              Bb        F/A  C
streets of Philadelphia

Bb  F/A  C

[Verse 2]
        F
I walked  the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
       Am
I heard  voices of friends, vanished and gone
          F
At night I  hear the blood in my veins
       Am
just as  black and whispery as the rain on the
              Bb        F/A  C
streets of Philadelphia

Bb  F/A  C 

[Bridge]
Bb                           Dm
   Ain't no angel gonna greet me
Bb                          F
   It's just you and I, my friend
Am                          Bb
   And my clothes don't fit me no more
        C
I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin

[Verse 3]
F
  The night is falling, I'm lying awake
     Am
I can  feel myself fading away
    F
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
          Am
Or will we  leave each other alone like this on the
              Bb        F/A  C
streets of Philadelphia

[Outro]
Bb  F/A  C
