[Intro]
C/G

[Verse]
G                   D/F#
 Looking out on the morning rain,
F                      C       C - G/B - Am7
 I used to feel so uninspired
G                         D/F#
 And when I knew I had to face another day,
F                       C      C - G/B - Am7
 Lord it made me feel so tired
Am7                Bm7
  Before the day I met you,
Am7             Bm7
  Life was so unkind
    Am7               Bm7         Am7
But you're the key to my piece of mind

[Chorus]
      C/D          G
Cause you make me feel
 C           G
You make me feel
 C           G                   Am7   C/D
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

[Verse 2]
G                 D/F#
 When my soul was in the lost and found
F                   C       C - G/B - Am7
 You came along to claim it
G                            D/F#
 I didn't know just what was wrong with me
F                         C      C - G/B - Am7
 Till your kiss helped me name it
Am7                 Bm7
  Now I'm no longer doubtful
Am7                  Bm7
  Of what I'm living for
    Am7                 Bm7                Am7
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more

[Chorus]
      C/D          G
Cause you make me feel
 C           G
You make me feel
 C           G                   Am7   C/D
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

[Bridge]
G                  Dm7
 Oh, baby what you done to me (what you done to me)
G                    Dm7
 You make me feel so good inside (good inside)
Cmaj7         Gm7
   And I just wanna be (wanna be)
Cmaj7            G6/B             Am7
Close to you you make me feel so alive

[Chorus]
C/D          G
You make me feel
 C           G
You make me feel
 C           G                   Am7 C/D
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

[Chorus]
C/D          G
You make me feel
 C           G
You make me feel
 C           G                   Am7   C/D
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
