[Verse 1]
C             G7                  C
They seek him here, they seek him there.
                G7              C
His clothes are loud, but never square.
F                                 C              A7
It will make or break him so he's got to buy the best,
            Dm7       G7          C
cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion.

[Verse 2]
            G7              C
And when he does his little rounds,
             G7               C
round the boutiques of London town,
F                        C               A7
eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends,
            Dm7       G7          C
cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion.

[Chorus]
           G7                             C
Oh, yes he is. (oh, yes he is), oh yes he is. (oh, yes he is.)
   F                           C
He thinks he is a flower to be looked at.
    F                              C                A7
And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight,
           Dm7       G7          C
he feels a dedicated follower of fashion.
           G7                               C
Oh, yes he is. (oh, yes he is.), oh, yes he is. (oh, yes he is).
       F                                   C
Theres one thing that he loves and that is flattery.
F                                C                 A7
One week he's in polka-dots, the next week he's in stripes.
             Dm7       G7          C
Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.

[Verse 3]
              G7                  C
They seek him here, they seek him there.
          G7                   C
In Regent Street and Leicester Square...
F                          C            A7
everywhere the Carnabetian Army marches on,
           Dm7       G7          C
each one a dedicated follower of fashion.

[Chorus]
           G7                              C
Oh, yes he is. (oh, yes he is), oh, yes he is.(oh, yes he is.)
    F                                    C
His world is built round discoteques and parties.
     F                           C                A7
This pleasure seeking individual always looks his best,
            Dm7       G7          C
cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion.
           G7                              C
Oh, yes he is. (oh, yes he is), oh, yes he is. (oh, yes he is.)
   F                                   C
He flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly.
   F                             C             A7
In matters of the cloth he is as fickle as can be,
            Dm7       G7          C        A7
cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion.
       Dm7       G7          C        A7
He's a dedicated follower of fashion.
       Dm7       G7          C      
He's a dedicated follower of fashion.
