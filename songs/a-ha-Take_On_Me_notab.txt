[Intro]
Bm E A D A

[Verse 1]
Bm          E  A                D       A/C#
Talking away,  I don’t know what I’m to say
     Bm          E    A             D      A/C#
I’ll say it anyway, today’s another day to find you
Bm        E   F#m                      D
  Shyin' away, I’ll be coming for your love, OK?

[Chorus]
A   E/G# F#m  D
Take on me  (take on me)
A   E/G# F#m  D
Take me on  (take on me)
A   E/G# F#m  D
I’ll be gone
           A  E  D/F#  E
in a day or two

[Verse 2]
    Bm            E     A             D         A/C#
So, needless to say I'm odds and ends, but I'll be
Bm          E   A                    D        A/C#
stumbling awake slowly learning that life is OK
Bm         E  F#m                   D
Say after me,  it’s no better to be safe than sorry

[Chorus]
A   E/G# F#m  D
Take on me  (take on me)
A   E/G# F#m  D
Take me on  (take on me)
A   E/G# F#m  D
I’ll be gone
           A  E  D/F#  E
in a day or two

[Verse 3]
        Bm                E        A            D        A/C#
Oh, the things that you say, yeah, is it life or just to play
   Bm         E         A                   D        A/C#
My worries away, you’re all the things I’ve got to remember
Bm                 E   F#m                  D
   You are shying away, I’ll be coming for you anyway

[Chorus]
A   E/G# F#m  D
Take on me  (take on me)
A   E/G# F#m  D
Take me on  (take on me)
A   E/G# F#m  D
I’ll be gone
    A   E/G# F#m  D
In a day
    Take on me  (take on me)

A   E/G# F#m  D
Take me on  (take on me)
A   E/G# F#m  D
I’ll be gone (take on me)
    A   E/G# F#m  D
In a day
    Take me on

(Fade out)
A   E/G# F#m  D ...
