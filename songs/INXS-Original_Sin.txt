[Verse 1]
Em                     Bm
You might know of the original sin,
   Em                     Bm
and you might know how to play with fire
Em                      Bm                       Em
But did you know of the murder committed, in the name of love yeahh!
                  Bm
You thought what a pity


[Chorus]
F#m            D               A              Bm
Dream on white boy, white boy, dream on black girl, black girl
Em               G            D                                     F#m  A
Then wake up to a brand new day, to find your dreams have washed away

[Verse 2]
Em                      Bm
There was a time when I did not care,
    Em                        Bm
and there was a time when the facts did stand
Em                   Bm      
There is a dream and held by me,
       Em                           Bm
well I'm sure you had to see its open arms


[Chorus]
F#m            D               A              Bm
Dream on white boy, white boy, dream on black girl, black girl
Em               G            D                                     F#m  A
Then wake up to a brand new day, to find your dreams have washed away

Black boy, white girl
