[Verse 1]

G
True love will find you in the end
C                                   G
You'll find out just who was your friend
Em                        Am
Don’t be sad, I know you will,
C
But don’t give up until
C                               G
True love will find you in the end.


[Verse 2]

G
This is a promise with a catch
C                                    G
Only if you're looking can it find you
G
‘Cause true love is searching too
C
But how can it recognize you
            G
Unless you step out into the light, the light?
Em                        Am
Don’t be sad, I know you will,
C
But don’t give up until
C                               G
True love will find you in the end.
