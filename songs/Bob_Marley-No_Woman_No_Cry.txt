Said said
C       G/B      Am                 F
 said I remember when we used to sit
C             G/B           Am       F
 In the government yard in trenchtown
C       G/B          Am         F
  Oba obaserving the hypocrites
             C       G/B                     Am  F
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
C         G/B                Am                F
 good friends  we had oh     good friend we lost
C          G/B        Am              F
           along the way
C             G/B          Am            F
 In this bright future you cant forget your past
C            G/B    Am       F
So dry your tears I say


[Chorus]

C    G/B         Am  F
  No woman no cry
C    F        C    G
  No woman no cry
C    G/B         Am     F
  Here little darlin' don't shed no tears
C    F        C
  No woman no cry

C       G/B      Am                 F
 said I remember when we used to sit
C             G/B           Am       F
 In the government yard in trenchtown
C                G/B            Am     F
 And then Georgie would make a fire light
             C       G/B                     Am   F
     as it was log wood burnin through the nights
C         G/B                Am             F
   Then we would cook corn meal porridge
C          G/B        Am              F
of which I'll share with you        yeah
C             G/B          Am          F
     my feet is my only carriage    and so
C             G/B          Am
I've got to push on through
F
But while I'm gone


[Bridge]

C                     G/B          Am                  F
  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.
C                     G/B          Am                  F
  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.
C                     G/B          Am                  F
