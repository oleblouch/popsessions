F#         G#m
I know you wanted me to stay
      D#m                            B
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA and
F#           G#m
I heard that there's a special place
      D#m                             B
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day


[Refrain]
F#
  I'm having wicked dreams
G#m
  of leaving Tennessee
D#m
  Oh, Santa Monica
B
  I swear it's calling me
F#
  Won't make my mama proud
G#m
  It's gonna cause a scene
D#m
  She sees her baby girl
B
  I know she's gonna scream


[Pre-Chorus]
F#                 G#m
God, what have you done
                    D#m
You're a pink pony girl
                      B
And you dance at the club
         F#              G#m
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
                    D#m
On the stage in my heels
               B
It's where I belong down at the

[Verse 2]
F#         G#m
I'm up and jaws are on the floor
D#m                          B
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
F#                 G#m
Black lights and a mirror disco ball
D#m                          B
Every night's another reason why I left it all


[Refrain]
F#
  I thank my wicked dreams
G#m
  a year from Tennessee
D#m
  Oh, Santa Monica
B
  You've been too good to me
F#

B
  I know she's gonna scream
