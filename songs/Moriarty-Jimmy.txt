 Am                C
Jimmy, won't you please come home
            G                     F
Where the grass is green and the buffaloes roam
 Am                   C                   G
Come see Jimmy, your uncle Jim, and your auntie Jim and
      F
your cousin Jim
 Am                         C
Come home Jimmy 'cause you need a bath
           G                F
And your grandpa Jimmy is still gone daft

             Am              C
Now there's buffalo Jim and buffalo Jim
     G                    F
And Jim buffalo, now now didn't you know 
 Am                         C
Jim Jimmy Jimmy, it's your last cigarette
             G                     F
But there's buffalo piss and it's all kind of wet
Am                   C
  Jambo Jimmy you'd better hold your nose
     G                           F
All roads lead to roam with the buffaloes

Am  C  G  E7

[Chorus]
         Am                F       G            Am
And the Buffaloes used to say be proud of your name
     Am                F   G          Am
The Buffaloes used to say be what you are
     Am                F   G              Am
The Buffaloes used to say roam where you roam
     Am                F   G          Am
The Buffaloes used to say do what you do

[Verse 3]
          Am                        C
Hey, you gotta have a wash but you can't clean your name
        G                           F
You're now called Jimmy, you'll be Jimmy just the same
     Am                        C
The keys are in the bag in a chest by the door
    G                           F
And one of Jimmy's friends has taken the floor

 Am                C
Jimmy, won't you please come home
            G                     F
Where the grass is green and the buffaloes roam
 Am                C
Dear old Jimmy, forgot you're young
         G                F
But you can't ignore the buffalo song

Am  C  G  E7

And the Buffaloes used to say be proud of your name
     Am                F   G          Am
The Buffaloes used to say be what you are
     Am                F   G              Am
The Buffaloes used to say roam where you roam
     Am                F   G          Am
The Buffaloes used to say do what you do
          Am             F
If you remember you're unknown
 G               Am
Buffaloland will be your home
          Am             F
If you remember you're unknown
 G                        Am
Buffaloland will be your home
