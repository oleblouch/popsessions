[Intro]
Cm  Eb

[Verse 1]
Cm
  Words like violence
Ebm
  Break the silence
Ab
   Come crashing in,

Into my little world
Cm
  Painful to me
Ebm
  Pierce right through me
Ab
  Can't you understand

Oh, my little girl

[Chorus]
Fm
   All I ever wanted
Ab
   All I ever needed
   Cm       Bb
Is here in my arms
Fm               Ab
  Words are very unnecessary
Cm              B    B
They can only do harm

[Verse 2]
Cm
  Vows are spoken
Ebm
  To be broken
Ab
  Feelings are intense,

Words are trivial
Cm
  Pleasures remain,
Ebm
  So does the pain
Ab
  Words are meaningless

And forgettable

[Chorus]
Fm
   All I ever wanted
Ab
   All I ever needed
   Cm       Bb
Is here in my arms
Fm               Ab
  Words are very unnecessary
Cm              B    B
They can only do harm

[Chorus]
Fm
   All I ever wanted
Ab
   All I ever needed
   Cm       Bb
Is here in my arms
Fm               Ab
  Words are very unnecessary
Cm              B
They can only do harm
Fm
   All I ever wanted
Ab
   All I ever needed
   Cm       Bb
Is here in my arms
Fm               Ab
  Words are very unnecessary
Cm              B    B
They can only do harm
