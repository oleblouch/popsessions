 Well it's been building up inside of me for oh, I don't know how long
D                                      G                   A
 I don't know why, but I keep thinkin' somethin's bound to go wrong
Em             A
 But she looks in my eyes
F#m           B7**
 And makes me realize

         E
When she says (don't worry baby)
F#m         B7** 
Don't worry baby (don't worry baby, everything will turn out alright)

 I know I should've kept my mouth shut when I started to brag about my car
D                                      G                A
 But I can't back down now 'cause I've pushed the other guys too far
Em            A
 She makes me come alive
F#m           B7
 And makes me wanna drive

         E

F#m         B7 
Don't worry baby (don't worry baby, everything will turn out alright)
