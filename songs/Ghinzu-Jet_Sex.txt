By Ghinzu
tabbed by Homer

Ghinzu is an awsome Belgian band, part of the "Belgian wave" which has invaded Europe
these last months (with Sharko, Girls in Hawaii, Hollywood Porn Stars). Kind of little
brothers of the band called Deus. they have released two albums: "electronic jacuzzi"
and the last one "blow" which is one of the greatest albums of the year 2004!! they're
aren't already "rock stars" but they really KICK ASS!


I don't know if it's very accurate but that's what i hear on the CD!! But basically it's
played by a piano so i may have simplified some stuffs but it sounds good! Well, i think
so...
This is a great song  by a great band!! And quite easy!
Don't hesitate if you have any comments!!

A secret sky for us to go

You've never been before, oh no

A jumbo jet, just you and me

No parachute, it's pilot free
