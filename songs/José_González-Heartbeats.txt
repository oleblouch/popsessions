[Verse]

  C    
One night to be confused
  C
One night to speed up truth
  Am
We had a promise made
 Fmaj7
Four hands and then away
        
  C
Both under influence
  C
We had divine scent
  Am    
To know what to say
  Fmaj7 
Mind is a razor blade
        

[Chorus]

  C
To call for hands of above
  
To lean on
  Am
Wouldn't be good enough
  Fmaj7
For me, no


[Verse 2]

  C
One night of magic rush
  C
The start a simple touch
  Am
One night to push and scream
 Fmaj7
And then relief

  C     
Ten days of perfect tunes
  C
The colors red and blue
  Am
We had a promise made
 Fmaj7
We were in love


[Chorus 2]      

  C
To call for hands of above
      
To lean on
  Am
Wouldn't be good enough
  Fmaj7
For me, no

  C
To call for hands of above
        
To lean on      
  Am
Wouldn't be good enough


[Interlude]

        G                              Fmaj7
And you, you knew the hands of the devil
        G                       Fmaj7
And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth
                      Fmaj7
Sharing different heartbeats
           Am
In one night
  

[Outro]

C       
To call for hands of above

To lean on
  Am
Wouldn't be good enough
 Fmaj7
For me, no
  C     
To call for hands of above

To lean on
 Am
Wouldn't be good enough
 Fmaj7
For me, no
