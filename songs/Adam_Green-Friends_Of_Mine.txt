[Intro]
E  C#m  A  B
E  C#m  A  B

[Verse 1]
       E                C#m
And we live on borrowed time
         A                 B
But this headshot's pretty good
          E                C#m
I've been scheming for too long
       A                 B
I was starstruck by your mom

[Bridge]
E                  C#m
We fall in love by accident
F#m             B 
  A heavenly coincedence
E                  C#m
No matter what you think is true
F#m             B 
  Let me introduce you to

[Chorus]
  A  B         E
Some friends of mine
  A  B         E
Oh friends of mine
  A  B         E
Oh friends of mine
  A  B         E
Oh friends of mine

[Verse 2]
       E                C#m
And we break for passing cars
       A              B
In the pistol-ripping chase
     E                 C#m
I regret the drugs you lost
     A                  B
So I skipped our second date

[Bridge]
E                  C#m
We fall in love by accident
F#m             B 
  A heavenly coincedence
E                  C#m
no matter what you think is true
F#m             B 
  Let me introduce you to

[Chorus]
  A  B         E
Some friends of mine
  A  B         E
Oh friends of mine
  A  B         E
Oh friends of mine
  A  B         E
Oh friends of mine

[Solo]
E  C#m  A  B

[Bridge]
E                  C#m
We fall in love by accident
F#m             B 
  A heavenly coincedence
E                  C#m
no matter what you think is true
F#m             B 
  Let me introduce you to

[Outro]
A         B             E
  Can't figure out this place
A          B              E  
  Guess someone hates my guts
A           B     C#m
I handed him the sign
  A  B        E
Oh friends of mine
