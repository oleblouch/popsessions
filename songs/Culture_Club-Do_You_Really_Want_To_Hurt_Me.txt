[Verse 1]

G        D/F#     Em
 Give me time, to realise my crime;
G       D/F#      Em
 Let me love, and steal.
G       D/F#   Em
 I have danced inside your eyes;
G        D/F# Em
 How can I be real?


[Chorus 1]

G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to hurt me?
G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to make me cry?
C         G                  Am 
 Precious kisses, words that burn me;
Bm                    Bm     [ Bm/E ]
 Lovers never ask you why.

G      D/F#               Em
 In my heart, the fire is burning,
G          D/F#           Em
 Choose my colour, find a star.
C         G             Am 
 Precious people always tell me;
Bm/D                       Bm
 That's a step, a step too far.


[Chorus 2]

G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to hurt me?
G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to make me cry?
C       G              Am 
 Do you really want to hurt me?
Bm                     G    G  Am  | Bb | % | Ab | Gm | % |
 Do you really want to make me cry-y?


[Verse 2]

G          D/F#        Em
 Words are few, I have spoken,
G        D/F#             Em
 I could waste a thousand years.
C           G                 Am 
 Wrapped in sorrow, words are token,
Bm                        Bm        [ Bm/E ]
 Come inside and catch my tears.

G            D/F#            Em
 You've been talking, but be-lieve me,
G        D/F#            Em
 If it's true, you don't know.
C         G               Am 
 This boy loves without a reason,
Bm                       Bm     [ Bm/E ]
 I'm prepared to let you go.


[Bridge 1]

C                 D                  C         D
 If it's love you want from me, then take it a-way.
C                 D                  C      D
 Everything's not what you see; it's over a-gain.


[Chorus 3]

G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to hurt me?
G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to make me cry?
C       G              Am 
 Do you really want to hurt me?
Bm                     G    G  Am  | Bb | % | Ab | Gm | % |
 Do you really want to make me cry-y?

[Chorus 4]

G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to hurt me?
G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to make me cry?
C       G              Am

G       D/F#           G       Bb
 Do you really want to make me cry?
