Title: The Winner Takes It All
Artist: ABBA

Transcribed in friendly G, ABBA's recording is in F#, however.
To match the key of the recording:
- transpose this chord sheet -1 to F# or
- tune down the guitar on step to Eb-Ab-Db-G-Bb-Eb or
- transpose this chord sheet -2 to F and use a capo 1st fret
- transpose this chord sheet -5 to D and use a capo 4th fret (my preferred option)

Novice players may leave out the slash chords (see voicings below) and just
play the regular shapes (E7 instead of E7/G#, D instead of D/F#  etc.).

[Verse]
              G
I don't wanna talk
                   D/F#
About things we've gone through
                    Am/E
Though it's hurting me
              D
Now it's history

               G
I've played all my cards
                       D/F#
And that's what you've done too
                Am/E
Nothing more to say
               D
No more ace to play


[Chorus]
                    G
The winner takes it all
    B7             Em
The loser standing small
  E7/G#         Am
Beside the victory
                D
That's her destiny


[Verse]
              G
I was in your arms
             D/F#
Thinking I belonged there
                  Am/E
I figured it made sense
              D
Building me a fence

              G
Building me a home
                D/F#
Thinking I'd be strong there
            Am/E
But I was a fool
               D
Playing by the rules


[Bridge]
                     G
The gods may throw a dice
      B7               Em
Their minds as cold as ice
    E7/G#   Am
And someone way down here
              D
Loses someone dear


[Chorus]
                    G
The winner takes it all
    B7           Em
The loser has to fall
     E7/G#           Am
It's simple and it's plain
                D
Why should I complain?


[Verse]
           G
But tell me does she kiss
               D/F#
Like I used to kiss you?
                 Am/E
Does it feel the same
                    D
When she calls your name?

              G
Somewhere deep inside
                D/F#
You must know I miss you
               Am/E
But what can I say
               D
Rules must be obeyed


[Bridge 2]
           G
The judges will decide
    B7           Em
The likes of me abide
    E7/G#         Am
Spectators of the show
               D
Always staying low


[Bridge 3]
                G
The game is on again
  B7         Em
A lover or a friend
  E7/G#          Am
A big thing or a small
                    D
The winner takes it all


[Verse]
              G
I don't wanna talk
                D/F#
If it makes you feel sad
            Am/E
And I understand
                        D
You've come to shake my hand

       G
I apologize
                D/F#
If it makes you feel bad
             Am/E
Seeing me so tense
             D
No self-confidence, but you see â€¦Z


[Outro]

                   | G | G B7 | Em | Em E7/G# |
The winner takes it all
   [ E7/G# ]        | Am | % | D | % |                
The winner takes it all ...

G          B7 Em        Em E/G#
 So the winner takes it a -all
Am            D
 And the loser has to fall
G           B7  Em       Em E/G#
 Throw a di-ice, cold as ice
Am             D
 Way down here, someone dear
G           B7  Em      Em  E/G#
 Takes it a-all, has to fall
Am                     D
 It seems plain to me ...
