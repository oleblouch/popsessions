[Verse 1]
D                          C                          D                  C
  Take the National Express when your life's in a mess, it will make you smile
D                       C                         D                 C
  All human life is here, from the feeble old dear to the screaming child
D                           C                          D             C
  From the student who knows, that to have one of those, would be suicide
D                   C                    D              C
  To the family man, manhandling the pram with paternal pride

[Chorus]
                  D                     G                     A7
And everyone sing ba ba baba ba ba baba ba ba baba ba ba baba ba ba baba alright
      D      G         A7      D
we're going where the air, is free


[Verse 2]
D                        C                        D                   C
  On the National Express there's a jolly hostess, selling crisps and tea
D                               C                     D               C
  She'll provide you with drinks and theatrical winks, for a sky-high fee
D                          C                              D               C
  Mini skirts were in style when she danced down the aisle, back in sixty three
D                         C                          D               C
  But it's hard to get by, when your arse is the size of a small country

[Chorus]
                  D                     G                     A7
And everyone sing ba ba baba ba ba baba ba ba baba ba ba baba ba ba baba alright
      D      G         A7      D
we're going where the air, is free

[Outro]

Tomorrow belongs to me.. 

When you're sad and feeling blue, with nothing better to do,

don't just sit there feeling stressed, take a trip on the National Express..

On the National Express..
