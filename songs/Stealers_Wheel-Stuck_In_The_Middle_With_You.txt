[Verse 1]

D
Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
D
I got the feeling that something ain't right
       G7
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
D
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
A
Clowns to the left of me
C             G             D
Jokers to the right, here I am

Stuck in the middle with you


[Verse 2]

D
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
D
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
   G7
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
D
Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place
A
Clowns to the left of me,
C             G             D
Jokers to the right, here I am,

Stuck in the middle with you.


[Bridge]

G7
Well you started out with nothing and you're proud that you're a
D
Self-made man
G7
And your friends they all come crawlin', slap you on the back and say
   D              Am7
Please....     Please.....


[Verse 3]

D
Trying to make some sense of it all
D
But I can see that it makes no sense at all
 G7
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
D
Cause I don't think that I can take any more
A
Clowns to the left of me,
C             G             D
Jokers to the right, here I am,

Stuck in the middle with you.
