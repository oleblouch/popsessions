[Verse]
C
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
             C#dim7    Dm7          G7  
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Dm7         G7         Dm7        G7   Dm7   
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
        G7         G7#5
Now the jingle hop has begun

C
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
             C#dim7   Dm7         G7  
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dm7         G7          Dm7         G7   D7  
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
       G7        C   C7  
In the frosty air

       F                     F#dim7
What a bright time, it's the right time
   C/G             C
To rock the night away
       Am7  D9        Am7   D9   G7  
Jingle bell time is a swell time
      Dm7          G7
To go glidin' in a one horse sleigh

C
Giddy up jingle horse, pick up your feet
        Em7b5/A#  A7#5
Jingle around the clock
F                     Fm            D7  
Mix and a mingle in a jinglin' beat
           G7          C    C#dim    Dm7    G7   
That's the jingle bell rock

C
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
             C#dim7   Dm7         G7  
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dm7         G7          Dm7         G7   D7  
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
       G7        C   C7  
In the frosty air

       F                     F#dim7
What a bright time, it's the right time
   C/G             C
To rock the night away
       Am7  D9        Am7   D9   G7  
Jingle bell time is a swell time
      Dm7          G7
To go glidin' in a one horse sleigh

Mix and a mingle in a jinglin' beat
           G7          D7  
That's the jingle bell 
           G           D7  
That's the jingle bell
           G7          C   Dm7    B    C
That's the jingle bell rock
