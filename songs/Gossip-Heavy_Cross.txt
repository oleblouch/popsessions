[Intro]
                  Em               
ooohh oooh oooh  ooooh 
                 D               
ooohh oooh oooh  ooooh
                  Em               
ooohh oooh oooh  ooooh 
                 D               
ooohh oooh oooh  ooooh

[Verse 1]
       Em                        
It's a cruel cruel world, to face on your own,
  D
A heavy cross, to carry alone,
    Em
The lights are on, but everyone's gone,
         D
And it's cruel

[Verse 2]
       Em
It's a funny way, to make ends meet,
          D
when the lights are out on every street,
   Em
It feels alright, but never complete,
D             
  without you,

[Chorus]
        Em                                   D
I trust you, if it's already been done, undo it,
         Em                             D
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it,
        Em
All the rainy nights, even the coldest days,
       D
you're moments ago, but seconds away,
    Em                                          D
The principal of nature, it's true but, it's a cruel world,

[Instrumental]
                   Em               
ooohh oooh oooh  ooooh 
                 D               
ooohh oooh oooh  ooooh
                  Em               
ooohh oooh oooh  ooooh 
               D               
oooo - woah   woooah

[Verse 3]
       Em
We can play it safe, or play it cool,
D
follow the leader, or make up all the rules,
Em
whatever you want, the choice is yours,
D
  So choose,

[Chorus]
        Em                                   D
I trust you, if it's already been done, undo it,
         Em                             D
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it,
      Em                   D
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh , yeah-eah,
      Em                  D
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh, yeah-eah, yeeh-eah, yeah-eah,
(Strum Em four times followed by four taps
Strum D four times followed by four taps ) (x2)
        Em                                D
I trust you, it's already been done, undo it,
         Em                             D
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it,
      Em           D
ei ei ei, woah wo, yeah-eah
      Em                        D
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, yeah-eah, yeah-eah, yeah-eah, x2
       Em
I trust you.
