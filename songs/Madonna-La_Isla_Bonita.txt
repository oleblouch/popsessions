[Intro] 
Am G
Como puede ser verdad

[Verse]
Am             G            Am
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
F    Am        C            G
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Am                 G              Am
A young girl with eyes like the desert
F  Am               C             G
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Am            G
Tropical the island breeze
Dm             C
All of nature wild and free
G                Dm
This is where I long to be
Dm        Am
La isla bonita
Am              G
  And when the samba played
Dm               C
  The sun would set so high
     G                   Dm
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
     Em           Am
Your Spanish lullaby

[Verse]
Am        G            Am
I fell in love with San Pedro
F       Am         C                G
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Am         G      Am
        Te dijo te amo
F     Am            C                     G
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Am            G
Tropical the island breeze
Dm             C
All of nature wild and free
G                Dm
This is where I long to be
Dm        Am
La isla bonita
Am              G
  And when the samba played
Dm               C
  The sun would set so high
     G                   Dm
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
     Em           Am
Your Spanish lullaby

[Bridge]
Dm        Bb            C            Dm
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
           Dm         Bb            C            
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Dm          Bb        C            Dm
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
         Dm           Bb         C    E      Am
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
Dm             C
All of nature wild and free

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
     Em           Am    F  G
Your Spanish lullaby

Am            G
Tropical the island breeze
Dm             C
All of nature wild and free
G                Dm
This is where I long to be
Dm        Am
La isla bonita
Am              G
  And when the samba played
Dm               C
  The sun would set so high
     G                   Dm
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
     Em           Am    F  G
Your Spanish lullaby
