[Verse]

 Em                                          Em  A  B    A  
    It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
 Em                                          Em  A  B    A
    Sunshine she's here,  You can take a break
          Em                                    Em  A  B    A
    I'm a hot air balloon, That could go to space
             Em                                     Em  A  B    A
    With the air, Like I don't care,  Baby by the way

 Em                                         Em A B    A
