Sirens call

[Verses]
D5                  Gm
Whatever way, the same
         C      D5
Nothing according to plan
            C                 D5
If i could just see clearly, into you
               Gm                 C         D5
The same face every day, the sirens calling away
           C
This mean so much more
              Dm
The floating boat is carrying me
                  Bb
and i can live my story differently
                   F
the greedy sirens are chewing all around me
              C
While i sing oh oh oh oh oh 

                Dm
On the falling shoals, i wonder why me ?
                  Bb
On my way to the falls, i hope you see
                      F
We are heading to the wall even if you are sorry,
             C         Dm
While i sing oh  oh oh oh oh oh

 Dm                   Bb
In my sleep, nothing same
                      F
nothing according to plan
            Am                  Dm
If i could be someone, without you
                      Bb
The same smile everyday
                    F
The sirens calling away
           Am
This mean so much more
