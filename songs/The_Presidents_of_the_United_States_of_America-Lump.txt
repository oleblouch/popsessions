Capo 4.

3 chords is all there is to this one. Super straight-forward. The chord changes 
can be a little tricky just from reading it, but just remember that they're all 
two bars long and listen to the original if you need a refresher. The chorus 
starts on the A from the end of the verse.


[Verse 1]

A
Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh
G                                   A
  Totally motionless except for her heart
                            G
Mud flowed up into Lump's pajamas
                                        A
She totally confused all the passing piranhas


[Chorus]

She's Lump, she's Lump
            D
She's in my head
      A
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
             D
She might be dead


[Verse 2]

A                                   G
 Lump lingered last in line for brains,
                                               A
And the ones she got were sort of rotten and insane
                                      G
Small thing's so sad that birds could land
                                            A
Is Lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?


[Chorus]

She's Lump, she's Lump
            D
She's in my head
      A
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
             D
She might be dead


[Verse 3]

A                                       G
 Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove
                                        A
Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love
                                   G
She spent her twenties between the sheets
                              A
Life limped along at subsonic speeds


[Chorus]

She's Lump, she's Lump
            D
She's in my head
      A
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump
             D
She might be dead


[Outro]

A                                     D
 Is this Lump out of my head, I think so
A                                     D
 Is this Lump out of my head, I think so, yeah
A                                     D
 Is this Lump out of my head, I think so
A                            
 Is this Lump out of my head
