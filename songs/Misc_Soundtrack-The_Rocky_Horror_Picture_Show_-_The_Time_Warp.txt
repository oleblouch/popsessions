[Verse 1]
          A                B
   It's astounding; time is  fleeting
G       D           A                                           B
madness   takes its toll.  But listen closely - not for very much longer
G           D         A
I've got to - keep control.
    A                  B           
I remember - Doing the Time Warp   
G        D               A
Drinking   those moments when
                    A        
the blackness would hit me - 
                      B
and the void would be calling....

[Refrain]
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!
  
[Chorus]
N.C.                         E                          A
It's just a jump to the left - and then a step to the ri-ight
N.C.                         E                         A
With your hands on your hips - you bring your knees in tight
                    D                                 A
But it's the pelvic thrust - that really drives you insa-ane
 
[Refrain]
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!

[Verse 2]
        A                   B        
It's so dreamy - Oh fantasy free me! 
             G       D     A
So you can't  see me - no, not at all.
             A                           B
In another dimension, with voyeuristic intention,
         G     D        A
Well secluded    I'll see all.
                A             
With a bit of a mind flip 
                B
you're into the time slip
    G       D               A
And nothing can ever be the same
                        A          
You're spaced out on sensation 
                    B
Like you're under sedation!

[Refrain]
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!

[Bridge]
            A
Well, I was walking down the street just-a having a think
                                       A7            D
When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink, well, it shook me up,
                                 A
it took me by surprise, he had a pick-up truck and the devil's eyes,
   E                  D              A
He stared at me and I felt a change, time meant nothing, never would again.

[Refrain]
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!

[Chorus]
N.C.                         E                          A
It's just a jump to the left - and then a step to the ri-ight
N.C.                        E                         A
Put your hands on your hips - you bring your knees in tight
                    D                                 A
But it's the pelvic thrust - that really drives you insa-ane

[Refrain]
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!

Wooooo! (Tap Dance Break)

Let's do the Time Warp again!
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!

[Chorus]
N.C.                         E                          A
It's just a jump to the left - and then a step to the ri-ight
                             E                         A
With your hands on your hips - you bring your knees in tight
                    D                                 A
But it's the pelvic thrust - that really drives you insa-ane

[Outro]
F     C      G    D     A
Let's do the Time Warp again!
F     C      G    D     A       G*
Let's do the Time Warp again!
