[Intro]
   C            Am           Em           F           x2
Do do do do, do do do do, do do do do, do do do do

[Instrumental]
C    Am    Em    F

[Verse 1]
C      Am                 Em         F                C
  Understand the things I say, don't turn away from me
              Am               Em         F                C
Cause I spent half my life out there, you wouldn't disagree
            Am                   Em             F                     C
D'you see me, d'you see, do you like me, do you like me standing there
            Am                   Em             F                       C
D'you notice, d'you know, do you see me, do you see me, does anyone care

[Chorus 1]
       Am                 Em                  F                 C
Unhappiness, where's when I was young, and we didn't give a damn
               Am             Em              F                C
'Cause we were raised, to see life as fun and take it if we can
         Am                Em             F                            C
My mother, my mother she'd hold me, she'd hold me, when I was out there
         Am              Em              F                         C
My father, my father, he liked me, oh he liked me, does anyone care

[Instrumental]
(C)    Am    Em    F

[Verse 2]
C      Am                Em          F            C
  Understand what I've become, it wasn't my design
           Am               Em         F               C
And people everywhere think some-thing better than I am
              Am                Em                 F                             C
But I miss you, I miss 'cause I liked it, 'cause I liked it, when I was out there
               Am                    Em                   F                         C
D'you know this, d'you know, you did not find me, you did not find, does anyone care

[Chorus 2]
       Am                 Em                  F                 C
Unhappiness, where's when I was young, and we didn't give a damn
               Am             Em              F                C
'Cause we were raised, to see life as fun and take it if we can
         Am                Em             F                            C
My mother, my mother she'd hold me, she'd hold me, when I was out there
         Am              Em              F                         C
My father, my father, he liked me, oh he liked me, does anyone care

[Outro]
              Am
Does anyone care
              Em
Does anyone care
              F
Does anyone care
              C
Does anyone care
              Am
Does anyone care
              Em
Does anyone care
              F
Does anyone care
   C            Am           Em           F           x3
Do do do do, do do do do, do do do do, do do do do

[Instrumental]
C    Am    Em    F    C
