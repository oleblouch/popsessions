Dm Cadd9 Am F
Dm Cadd9 Am F


[Verse 1]
Dm                  Cadd9
   His father was a drinker
        Am              F
And his mother cried in bed
Dm                      Cadd9
   Folding John Wayne's t-shirts
         Am               F
When the swingset hit his head
Dm                      Cadd9
   The neighbors, they adored him
        Am           F
For his humor and his conversation
Dm                     Cadd9
   Look underneath the house there
         Am                         F
Find the few living things, rotting fast in their sleep
       Dm                 Cadd9
Of the dead, twenty-seven people
     Am                              F
Even more, they were boys with their cars, summer jobs
       Dm     Cadd9
Oh, my Go-o-o-od
Am         F
   Are you one of them?


[Verse 2]
Dm                      Cadd9
   He dressed up like a clown for them
         Am                   F
With his face paint white and red
Dm                   Cadd9
   And on his best behavior
     Am               F
In a dark room on the bed
               Dm                          Cadd9
He kissed them all, he'd kill ten thousand people
       Am                           F
With a sleight of his hand, running far, running fast
       Dm                          Cadd9
To the dead, he took off all their clothes for them
         Am                         F
He put a cloth on their lips, quiet hands, quiet kiss
       Dm     Cadd9
On the mo-o-o-outh
Am F


[Outro]
Dm                  Cadd9
   And in my best behavior
     Am               F
I am really just like him
Dm                  Cadd9
   Look beneath the floorboards
        Am             F
For the secrets I have hid
