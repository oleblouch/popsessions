[Intro]

E   E   E   E


[Verse]
A              D
Where it began I can't begin to knowin'
A                            E
But then I know it's growin' strong
A                  D
Was in the spring, then spring became a summer
A                               E
Who'd have believed you'd come along


[Pre-Chorus]
A      A6
Hands,    touching hands
E            D                      E
Reaching out, touching me, touching you


[Chorus]
A         D    (D C# F#) D                          E
Sweet Caroline,          good times never seemed so good
A         D    (D C# F#) D                     E
I'd be inclined          to believe they never would
D   C#m  Bm
But now  I'm


[Verse 2]
A                  D
Look at the night    and it don't seem so lonely
A                       E
We fill it up with only two
A                 D
And when I hurt,    hurting runs off my shoulder
A                           E
How can I hurt when holdin' you


[Pre-Chorus]
A     A6
Warm,    touching warm
E            D                      E
Reaching out, touching me, touching you


[Chorus]
A         D    (D C# F#) D                          E
Sweet Caroline,          good times never seemed so good
A         D    (D C# F#) D                     E
I'd be inclined          to believe they never would
D   C#m  Bm
Oh  no   no

[Chorus]
A         D    (D C# F#) D                          E
Sweet Caroline,          good times never seemed so good
A         D    (D C# F#) D                    E
Sweet Caroline,          I believe they never could
A         D    (D C# F#) D                          E
Sweet Caroline,          good times never seemed so good
