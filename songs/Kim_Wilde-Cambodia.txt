        Dm
Well he was in  Thailand based. She was an airforce wife.
        F
He used to fly weekends, it was the easy life.
        C
But then it turned around, and he began to change.
        Gm                           C
She didn't wonder then, she didn't think it strange.
        Dm
But then he got a call, he had to leave that night.
        F
He couldn't say too much, but it would be alright.
        C
He didn't need to pack, they'd meet the next night.
        Gm              C            Dm      F       Gm      C       Dm
He had a job to do, flying to Cambodia.                                         

        Dm
And as the nights passed by, she tried to trace the past.
        F
The way he used to look, the way he used to laugh.
        C
I guess she'll never know, what got inside his soul.
        Gm                  C
She couldn't make it out, just couldn't take it all.
        Dm
He had the saddest eyes the girl had ever seen.
        F
He used to cry some nights, as though he lived a dream.
        C
And as she held him close, he used to search her face.
        Gm                       C               Dm      F       Gm      C       Dm
As though she knew the truth, lost inside Cambodia.                                     

        Dm
But then a call came through, they said he'd soon be home.
        F           Bb                 Gm
She had to pack a case and they would make a rendez-vous.       
        Dm
But now the year has passed and not a single word and
        F          Bb              Gm
all the love she knew has disappeared out in the haze.          
        Dm      Bb         Gm
Cambodia - Don't cry now - No tears now.

Dm F Bb Dm Gm

        Dm
And now the years have passed without a single word.
               F             Bb
But there is only one thing left I know for sure,
        C                Dm
She won't see his face again.
