C/G  3-x-2-0-1-0

[Verse 1]
Am        C/G   F         G        C
She would never say where she came from 
Am    C/G       F      C       G7
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone 
Am        D7      G
While the sun is bright 
   Am     D7       G
Or in the darkest night 
       C
No one knows 
              G7
She comes and goes 

[Chorus]
C   G    C     
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 
C         G      C
Who could hang a name on you? 
C        G           Bb    F
When you change with every new day 
G               C        G
Still I'm gonna miss you

[Verse 2] 
      Am       C/G    F        G     C
Don't question why she needs to be so free 
       Am       C/G      F    C      G7
She'll tell you it's the only way to be 
Am       D7        G
She just can't be chained 
     Am         D7         G
To a life where nothing's gained 
              C
And nothing's lost 
          G7
At such a cost 

[Chorus]
C   G    C     
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 
C         G      C
Who could hang a name on you? 
C        G           Bb    F
When you change with every new day 
G               C        G
Still I'm gonna miss you

[Verse 3]
Am         C/G     F       G         C
There's no time to lose, I heard her say 
Am         C/G      F         C     G7
Catch your dreams before they slip away 
Am    D7       G
Dying all the time 
Am        D7
Lose your dreams 
    G                 C
And you may lose your mind. 
             G7
Ain't life unkind? 

[Chorus]
C   G    C    
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 
C         G      C
Who could hang a name on you? 
C        G           Bb    F
When you change with every new day 
G               C        G
Still I'm gonna miss you

[Chorus]
C   G    C    
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 
C         G      C
Who could hang a name on you? 
C        G           Bb    F
When you change with every new day 
G               C        G
Still I'm gonna miss you
