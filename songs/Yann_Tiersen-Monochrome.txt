[Verse 1]
Bm                D                       A                      G
Anyway, I can try anything, it's the same circle that leads to nowhere, and I'm tired now
Bm                   D                    A                   G
Anyway, I've lost my face, my dignity, my look, everything is gone, and I'm tired now
Bm       D         A                       G
Don't be scared, I found a good job, and I go to work
Bm       D   A                  G
Everyday on, my old bicycle you loved

[Verse 2]
Bm                  D                     A                       G
I am piling up some unread books under my bed, and I really think I'll never read again
Bm                    D                A                         G
No concentration just a white disorder everywhere around me, you know, I'm so tired now
Bm      D      A                   G
Don't worry, I often go to dinners and parties
Bm            D           A                         G
With some old friends who care for me, take me back home and stay

[Chorus]
G          Bm      G          Bm
Monochrome floors, monochrome walls
D    A       G    Bm  D           A       G      Bm
Only absence near me, nothing but silence around me
G          Bm    G          Bm
Monochrome flat, monochrome life
D    A       G    Bm  D           A       G      Bm
Only absence near me, nothing but silence around me

[Verse 3]
Bm                     D                      A                           G
Sometimes I search an event or something to remind me, but I've really got nothing in mind
Bm                   D                         A                           G
Sometimes I open the windows and listen people walking in the down streets, there is life out there
Bm       D         A                       G
Don't be scared, I found a good job, and I go to work
Bm       D   A                  G
Everyday on, my old bicycle you loved

[Verse 4]
Bm                D                       A                      G
Anyway, I can try anything, it's the same circle that leads to nowhere, and I'm tired now
Bm                   D                    A                   G
Anyway, I've lost my face, my dignity, my look, everything is gone, and I'm tired now
Bm      D      A                   G
Don't worry, I often go to dinners and parties
Bm            D           A                         G

[Chorus]
G          Bm      G          Bm
Monochrome floors, monochrome walls
D    A       G    Bm  D           A       G      Bm
Only absence near me, nothing but silence around me
G          Bm    G          Bm
Monochrome flat, monochrome life
D    A       G    Bm  D           A       G      Bm
Only absence near me, nothing but silence around me
