G              A7
   Satellite's gone
          C      Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
up to the skies
G                   A7
   Things like that drive me

out of my mind
Em           D         C

Am                          C
   I like to watch things on TV

G                  A7
  Soon it will be filled
              C      Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
with parking cars
Em            D        C
  I watched it for a little while
Am                          C
  I love to watch things on TV
