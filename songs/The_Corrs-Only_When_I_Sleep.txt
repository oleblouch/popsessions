[Verse 1]
Bm     A           E
You're only just a dreamboat 
              Bm
Sailing in my head
    A              E  
You swim my secret ocean
                  Bm
Of coral blue and red
     A                E  
Your smell is incense burning
                     G 
Your touch is silken yet
                      D 
It reaches through my skin
                G 
Moving from within
                   F#
And clutches at my breast 

[Chorus]
                     Bm
But it's only when I sleep 
                D 
I see you in my dreams 
                E
Got me spinning round and round
        Em     A  
Turning upside down
                    Bm
But I only hear you breathe
                D 
Somewhere in my sleep        
                E 
Got me spinning round and round
        Em     A
Turning upside down        
                     Bm
But it's only when I sleep

[Verse 2]
           A         E  
And when I wake from slumber
                     Bm 
Your shadow's disappeared
     A                E     
Your breath is just a sea mist 
               Bm  
Surrounding my body
    A                   E 
I'm working through the daytime
                      G
But when it's time to rest
                D 
I'm lying in my bed
                G 
Listening to my breath
                F#
Falling from the edge

[Chorus]
                     Bm
But it's only when I sleep 
                D 
I see you in my dreams 
                E
Got me spinning round and round
        Em     A  
Turning upside down
                    Bm
But I only hear you breathe
                D 
Somewhere in my sleep        
                E 
Got me spinning round and round
        Em     A
Turning upside down        
                     Bm
But it's only when I sleep

          D 
Yeah Yeah Yeah
          G
Yeah Yeah Yeah
          F#
Yeah Yeah Yeah
                     Bm
But it's only when I sleep

[Solo]
Bm, D, E, Em, A
Bm, D, E, Em, A, Bm

                         D 
It's reaching through my skin
                G
Moving from within
                   F#
And clutches at my breast...

[Chorus]
                     Bm
But it's only when I sleep 
                D 
I see you in my dreams 
                E
Got me spinning round and round
        Em     A  
Turning upside down
                    Bm
But I only hear you breathe
                D 
Somewhere in my sleep        
                E 
Got me spinning round and round
        Em     A
Turning upside down        
                     Bm
But it's only when I sleep
