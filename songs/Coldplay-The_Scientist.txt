[Verse]
Bm7             G                     D
   Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
                    Dsus2
You don't know how lovely you are
Bm7             G                    D
   I had to find you, tell you I need you,
              Dsus2
Tell you I’ll set you apart
Bm7               G                          D
   Tell me your secrets, and’ask me your questions
               Dsus2
Oh, let’s go back to the start
Bm7             G                  D
   Running in circles, coming up tails,
               Dsus2
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
G
  Nobody said it was easy
D             Dsus2
  It's such a shame for us to part
G
  Nobody said it was easy
D             A/D              D6/9    A/E Asus4 A
  No one ever said it would be this hard.
N.C.
Oh take me back to the start...

[Verse]
Bm7              G                      D
   I was just guessing at numbers and figures
                 Dsus2
Pulling the puzzles apart
Bm7                G                    D
   Questions of science, science and progress
                   Dsus2
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Bm7               G                        D
   Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
               Dsus2
Oh, and I rush to the start
Bm7             G                    D
   Running in circles, chasing our tails
                  Dsus2/C#
Coming back as we are

[Chorus]
G
  Nobody said it was easy
D                 Dsus2
  Oh, it’s such a shame for us to part
G
  Nobody said it was easy
D             A/D              D6/9  A/E Asus4 A
  No one ever said it would be so hard.
N.C.
I’m going back to the start.
