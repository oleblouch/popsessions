[Verse]

F#m          D
You were a child
                   A                E/G#
Crawling on your knees toward him
F#m               D
Making momma so proud
A                      E/G#        F#m   D
But your voice is too loud
                  A           E/G#
We like to watch you laughing
F#m                          D
You pick the insects off of plants
A                         E/G#
No time to think of consequences

Control yourself
                    A             E/G#
Take only what you need from it
F#m          D           A       E/G#
A family of trees wanting to be haunted

F#m                D

[Verse]

F#m          D
The water is warm
                 A             E/G#
But it's sending me shivers
F#m           D
    A baby is born
A                  E/G#
  Crying out for attention
F#m             D
   The memories fade
                       A                E/G#
Like looking through a fogged mirror
  F#m                     D
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
      A                            E/G#
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

A family of trees wanting to be haunted
