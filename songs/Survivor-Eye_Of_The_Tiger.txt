[Verse 1]

Am              F
   Risin' up, back on the street,
G                      Am
  Did my time, took my chances.
Am                             F
  Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet,
        G                     Am
Just a man and his will to survive.

Am                  F
  So many times, it happens too fast,
G                             Am
  You change your passion for glory
Am                            F
  Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past,
          G                        Am
You must fight just to keep them alive:


[Chorus]

G*    Am  Dm                            C               G
It's the    eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight -
       Dm                         Am   G
Rising up to the challenge of our ri - val.
         Dm                             C             G
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night,
          Dm          Em7          F  N.C.    Am
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.

Am


[Verse 2]

Am              F
Face to face, out in the heat,
G                      Am
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry.
Am                             F
They stack the odds, still we take to the street,
        G                     Am
For we kill with the skill to survive.


[Chorus]

G*    Am  Dm                            C               G
It's the    eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight -
       Dm                         Am   G
Rising up to the challenge of our ri - val.
         Dm                             C             G
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night,
          Dm          Em7          F  N.C.    Am
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.

Am


[Verse 3]

Am              F
Risin' up, straight to the top,
G                      Am
Had the guts, got the glory.
Am                             F
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop,
        G                     Am
Just a man and his will to survive.


[Chorus]

G*    Am  Dm                            C               G
It's the    eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight -
       Dm                         Am   G
Rising up to the challenge of our ri - val.
         Dm                             C             G
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night,
          Dm          Em7          F  N.C.    Am
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.
