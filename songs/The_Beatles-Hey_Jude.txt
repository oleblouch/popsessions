HEY JUDE ACOUSTIC- THE BEATLES

Here's the corrected tab. This isn't a tab of an actual recording, just a way to play 
original version on acoustic guitar without so many barre chords.

There has been some confusion with the whole D, Dmaj7, D7 part. I like to use the Dmaj7 
a means of chromatic descent, so I play it quickly between the D and the D7. I don't 
the correct musical jargon to describe what I mean, but.. hopefully you get it.
