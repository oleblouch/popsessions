[Verse 1]
F
Bluebirds are so natural 
        Bb              F
I wanna buy them for my friends
F
Bluebirds are so dismal
      Bb                 F    
And I want to trade mine in
      Bb                F
And I don't go out for brunch
      Bb               F
And I don't go out for cunts
      Bb               F
And I don't go out for months
           Bb                        F
Without my Barnes and Nobles credit card.

[Verse 2]
F
Cleaning out my wisdom teeth 
          Bb            F
I found a diamond in my gums
F
Cleaning out the kitchen
        Bb                    F
Found a spoon that played the drums
       Bb                   F
And despite the things they say
  Bb              F
I gave it up that day
    Bb            F
I'd never go that way
              C    Bb              F
Unless your daddy nailed me to the cross

[Chorus]
F
Suicide, suicide 
Bb                           F
Leaning out to everyone that hides
Bb                          F
breaking the chains on the things down low
Bb                          C
Where it stops I don't know how that goes

[Verse 3]
F
Bluebirds are so natural 
        Bb              F
I wanna buy them for my friends
F
Bluebirds are so dismal
      Bb                 F    
And I want to trade mine in
      Bb                   F
And despite the things they say
  Bb              F
I gave it up that day
    Bb            F
I'd never go that way
               C                   F
Unless your daddy nailed me to the cross
      C       Bb             F
Your daddy nailed me to the cross
