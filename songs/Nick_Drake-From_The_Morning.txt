A day once dawned
DaddG        G/B
And it was beautiful

A day once dawned

>From the ground

Then the night she fell
And the air was beautiful
Night she fell
All around

DaddG            G/B
So look see the days
DaddG                G/B
The endless coloured ways
DaddG         G/B
Go play the game
          Asus4
That you learnt

>From the morning

And now we rise
We are everywhere
And now we rise
>From the ground

And see she flies
She is everywhere
See she flies
All around

So look see the sights
The endless summer nights
Go play the game
That you learnt
>From the morning
