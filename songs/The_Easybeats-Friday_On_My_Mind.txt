Friday On My Mind chords
The Easy Beats

[Verse 1]

Em                      A  D
Monday morning feels so bad,
Em                 A   D
Ev'rybody seems to nag me
G                     B7
Coming Tuesday I feel better,
E                     Am
Even my old man looks good,
A 
Wednesday just don't go,
Dm
Thursday goes too slow,
                      C    E  A B7 E
I've got Friday on my mind

[Chorus]

A                     C#m
Gonna have fun in the city,
A                        C#m
Be with my girl she's so pretty,
D
She looks fine tonight,
F#                     Bm
She is out of sight to me,
D
Tonight....I spend my bread,
Bm
Tonight...I lose my head,
D                      A   E
Tonight...I got to get tonight

Am            D            G   E
Monday I have Friday on my mind.

[Verse 2]

Em                        A   D
Do the five day drag once more,
Em                        A    D
Know of nothing else that bugs me
G                         B7
More than working for the rich man,
E                              Am
Hey I'll change that scene one day,
A
Today I might be mad,
Dm
Tomorrow I'll be glad,
                      C    E   A B7 E
I've got Friday on my mind,

[Chorus]

A                     C#m
Gonna have fun in the city,
A                        C#m
Be with my girl she's so pretty,
D
She looks fine tonight,
F#                     Bm
She is out of sight to me,
D
Tonight....I spend my bread,
Bm
Tonight...I lose my head,
D                      A   E
Tonight...I got to get tonight
Am            D            G   E
Monday I have Friday on my mind.

A                     C#m
Gonna have fun in the city,
A                        C#m
Be with my girl she's so pretty....
