White writing - Carol Ann Duffy

Couplet 
F - Bb - Gm7 - A7 - Ebmaj7

Refrain
F - G7 - Bb - F

No vows written to wed you,I write them white,
my lips on yours,light in the soft hours of our married years.
No prayers written to bless you,I write them white,
your soul a flame,bright in the window of your maiden name.

Ref : I write them white… x2

No laws written to guard you,I write them white,
your hand in mine,palm against palm, lifeline, heartline.
No rules written to guide you,I write them white,
words on the wind,traced with a stick where we walk on the sand.

Ref : I write them white… x2

Bridge : 
C					Dm7
No laws written to guard you, I write them white,
C					Bb
No rules written to guide you, I write them white,
Am7				Ebmaj7 (x2)
No news written to tell you,I write it white,

No news written to tell you,I write it white,
foam on a waveas we lift up our skirts in the sea, wade,

Ref : I write them white…

(un accord par vers) 
F
see last gold sun behind clouds,
Gm7
inked water in moonlight.
Am
No poems written to praise you,
C4
I write them white.
