[Verse  1]

D                   G
I, I wish I could swim
D                                     G
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
C                                       D
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
        Am       Em            D
We can beat them, forever and ever
             C          G          D
Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day

[Verse 2]

D             G
I, I will be king
D                     G
and you, you will be queen
C                               D
Though nothing, will drive them away
          Am                   D
We can be heroes, just for one day
         C                 D
We can be us just for one day


[Verse 3]

D             G
I, I can remember (I remember)
D                G
standing by the wall (by the wall)
D                           G
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
D                              G
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
C                                D
And the shame, was on the other side
    Am               Em             D
Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
              C       G             D
And we can be heroes, just for one day


[Verse 4]

D              G
 We can be heroes
              D
just for one day
            G
We can be heroes
             D
just for one day
