[Verse 1]

     B             G#m            E                B
I am sailing, I am sailing, home again, 'cross the sea.
     C#7            G#m           C#m             B    F#
I am sailing stormy waters, to be near you, to be free.


[Verse 2]

     B            G#m            E                B
I am flying, I am flying, like a bird, 'cross the sky.
     C#7             G#m                C#m             B    F#
I am flying, passing high clouds, to be near you, to be free.

        B                G#m                  E                B
Can you hear me, can you hear me, through the dark night, far away?
     C#7            G#m          C#m               B   F#
I am dying, forever crying to be with you; who can say?

        B                G#m                  E               B
Can you hear me, can you hear me, through the dark night far away?
     C#7            G#m          C#m               B   F#
I am dying, forever crying to be with you; who can say?


[Verse 3]

       B               G#m            E                B
We are sailing, we are sailing, home again, 'cross the sea.
       C#7            G#m           C#m             B
We are sailing stormy waters, to be near you, to be free.
