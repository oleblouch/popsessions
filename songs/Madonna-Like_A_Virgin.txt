[Verse 1] 

                   D
   I made it through the wilderness, somehow I made it through.
Em                                    D
   Didn't know how lost I was, until I found you.
       
   I was beat,   incomplete,  I'd been had, I was sad and blue,
             Em             Bm             Em         Bm
    But you made me feel,      yeah, you ma...de me feel
               A
    shiny and new.


[Chorus]

        D
Like a virgin, touched for the very first time.
        Em                   D
Like a vi...rgin, when your heart beats, next to mine.


[Verse 2]

                   D                            
    Gonna give you all my love, boy, my fear is fading fast.
Em                                            D
    Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last.

    You're so fine and you're mine,

    make me strong, yeah, you make me bold.
              Em                Bm             Em            Bm
    Oh, your love thawed out,     yeah, your love thawed o...ut,
                         A
    what was scared and cold.


[Chorus]

        D
Like a virgin, touched for the very first time.
        Em                   D
Like a vi...rgin, when your heart beats, next to mine.


[Bridge]

            Bm E     Bm     E    Bm   E   Bm     E
          Oooh,       oooh,    oooh


[Verse 3]

              D
    You're so fine and you're mine, I'll be yours 'till the end of time,
                Em             Bm             Em          Bm
    'cause you made me feel,     yeah, you ma...de me feel
                     A
    I've nothing to hide.  


[Chorus]  

        D
Like a virgin, touched for the very first time.
        Em                   D
Like a vi...rgin, when your heart beats, next to mine.

repeat and fade
