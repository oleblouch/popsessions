[Intro]
A    Asus4 A Asus4

[Verse 1]
A               D
Pale, pubescent beasts
                 E
Roam through the streets
           F#m7
And coffee shops
      Bm7            D
Their prey gather in herds
                     Cadd9
Of stiff knee length skirts
                Bb7
And white ankle socks
    A                       D
But while they search for a mate
             E
My type hibernate
            F#m7
In bedrooms above
B7              D        A    Asus4 A Asus4
Composing their songs of love

[Verse 2]
 A             D
Young, uniform minds
            E
In uniform lines
            F#m7
And uniform ties
     Bm7
Run round
                  D
With trousers on fire
              Cadd9
And signs of desire
             Bb7
They cannot disguise
 A                   D
While I try to find words
                E
As light as the birds
             F#m7
That circle above
 B7          D        A      Asus4 A Asus4
To put in my songs of love

[Chorus]
F            Dm        A              F#m7
Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
F         Dm           A            E7
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
   A                   D
So sing while you have time
            E               F#m7
Let the sun shine down from above
    B7            D        A
And fill you with songs of love

[Instrumental]

B7 D A Asus4 A Asus4

[Chorus]
F            Dm        A              F#m7
Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
F         Dm           A            E7
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
   A                    D
So let's sing while we still can
            E               F#m7
While the sun hangs high up above
 B7          D   E   F#m7
Wonderful songs of love
 B7         D        A
Beautiful songs of love
