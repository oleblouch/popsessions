[Intro]

(coming soon)


B (1 strum)
Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball.
A (1 strum)
From Soho down to Brighton, I must have played them all.
G (1 strum)
But I ain't seen nothing like him, In any amusement hall.
F# (1 strum)
That deaf dumb and blind kid
F#
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

B B A D E x2

B
He stands like a statue, Becomes part of a machine.
A
Feeling all the bumpers,always playing clean.
G
He plays by intuition, The digit counter falls
F#(1 strum)
That deaf dumb and blind kid
F#
Sure plays a mean pin ball !

B B A D E x2

E      F#       B
He's a pin ball wizard
E      F#       B
There's got to be a twist
E      F#       B
A pin ball wizard's
G                 D
got such a supple wrist.

D           C       G
How do you think he does it? I don't know!
D        C        G
What makes him so good?'

B
He ain't got no distractions, Can't hear those buzzers and bells
A
Don't see lights a flashin, Plays by sense of smell.
G
Always gets a replay, Never seen him fall
F# (1 strum)
That deaf dumb and blind kid
F#
Sure plays a mean pin ball.

B B A D E x2

E         F# B
I thought I was
E         F#    B
The Bally table king.
E     F#   B
But I just handed
G                 D
My pin ball crown to him.

Even my favourite table, He can beat my best.

His disciples lead him in, And he just does the rest.

That deaf dumb and blind kid
