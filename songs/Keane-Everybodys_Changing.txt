[Verse]
C                        F
You say you wander your own land
    Dm
But when I think about it
  G                    C   Cmaj7   C   Cmaj7
I don't see how you can

       C
You're aching, you're breaking
     F
And I can see the pain in your eyes
     Dm
Says everybody's changing
    G               Am  Asus2  Am  Asus2
And I don't know why

[Chorus]
F           G
 So little time
C                       F
Try to understand that I'm
Dm                            G
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
  Em                      A
I try to stay awake and remember my name
    Dm                       G                   C  Cmaj7  C  Cmaj7
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same

       C               Cmaj7
You're gone from here, soon you will disappear
F
Fading into beautiful light
     Dm
'cos everybody's changing
    G               Am  Asus2  Am  Asus2
And I don't feel right

[Chorus]

Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
  Em                      A
I try to stay awake and remember my name
    Dm                       G
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same
