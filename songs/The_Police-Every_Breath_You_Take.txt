[Verse]
 
Gadd9
Every breath you take,
                Emadd9
Every move you make,
                Csus2
Every bond you break,
              Dsus2
Every step you take,
                Emadd9
I'll be watching you.

                Gadd9
Every single day,
                Emadd9
Every word you say,
                Csus2
Every game you play,
                Dsus2
Every night you stay,
              Gadd9
I'll be watching you.


[Chorus]

             Csus2
Oh, can't you see,
Csus2/Bb       Gadd9
You belong to me,
                Aadd9
How my poor heart aches,
                Dsus2
With every step you take,
                Gadd9
Every move you make,
                Emadd9
Every vow you break,
                Csus2
Every smile you fake,
                Dsus2
Every claim you stake,
             Emadd9
I'll be watching you.


[Interlude]

Eb
Since you've been gone, I've been lost without a trace,
F
I dream at night I can only see your face,
Eb
I look around but it's you I can't replace,
F
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace,
Eb
I keep crying baby, baby please.

Oh, can't you see,
Csus2/Bb       Gadd9
You belong to me,
                Aadd9
How my poor heart aches,
                Dsus2
With every step you take,
                Gadd9
Every move you make,
                Emadd9
Every vow you break,
                Csus2
Every smile you fake,
                Dsus2
Every claim you stake,
             Emadd9
I'll be watching you.
