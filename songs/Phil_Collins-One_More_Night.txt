[Verse]
  G           D             Em     D
    I've been trying ooh so long to let you know
  G         D          Em
    Let you know how I feel
  G            D           Em       D

[Chorus]
                   A        D              A   A5   D
    Please give me one more night, give me one more night
    A        D                 G      D  A
    One more night cos I can't wait forever
                 A        D              A   A5   D
    Give me just one more night, oh just one more night
       A        D                 G      D  A
    Oh one more night cos I can't wait forever
  
[Verse]
  G           D               Em     
    I've been sitting here so long
    D            G        D           Em
    Wasting time, just staring at the phone
  G           D                    Em       
    And I was wondering should I call you
    D             G             D    Em
    Then I thought maybe you're not alone

[Chorus]
                   A        D              A   A5   D
    Please give me one more night, give me one more night
    A        D                 G      D  A
    One more night cos I can't wait forever
                 A        D              A   A5   D
    Give me just one more night, oh just one more night
       A        D                 G      D  A
    Oh one more night cos I can't wait forever
  
  Bm7        D
      Like a river to the sea
  Bm7        C
      I will always be with you
  Bm7     D
      And if you sail away
  Bm7        C
      I will follow you
    

[Chorus]
            A        D              A   A5   D
    Give me one more night, give me one more night
    A        D                 G      D  A
    One more night cos I can't wait forever

[Verse]
  G                 D          Em               D
    I know there'll never be a time you'll ever feel the same
  G       D              Em
    And I know it's only words
  G            D               Em              D
    But if you change your mind  you know that I'll be here
  G              D        Em
    And maybe we both can learn
  

[Chorus]
                 A        D                   A   A5   D
    Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
        A        D                  G      D  A    
    Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
                 A        D                   A   A5   D    
    Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
        A        D           G           D  A    
    Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
