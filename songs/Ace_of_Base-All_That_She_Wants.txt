Ace of Base - All That She Wants

All chords are written for standard tuning... but you might find it much
easier to play if you have a capo at the 4th fret (figure out the new
chords by yourself).

The chords in brackets don't seem to be in the original but I think it
sounds better if you play them.

[Intro]
C#m                   B F#m
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

[Verse 1]
         C#
When she woke up late in the morning
              B            F#
light and the day had just begun
    C#                            
She opened up her eyes and thought
G#
  oh what a morning
C#
 It’s not a day for work
       F#m              (E)
It’s a day for catching tan
     C#            G#               F#
Just laying on the beach and having fun
     (G#)
She’s going to get you

[Chorus]
C#m                           B
All that she wants is another baby
      F#m
She’s gone tomorrow boy
C#m                           B       F#m
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She’s gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah

(All that she wants - all that she wants)

[Verse 2]
          C#m
So if you are in sight and the day is right
        B              F#m
She’s a hunter you’re the fox
    C#m
The gentle voice that talks to you
G#
  Won’t talk forever
C#m
 It’s a night for passion
        F#m              (E)
But the morning means goodbye
  C#m             G#m             F#m
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
     (G#m)
She’s going to get you

All that she wants... 

C#m  G#   B C

All that she wants...
