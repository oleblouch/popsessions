[Verse 1]
  Gm                                    Cm7
Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
  Eb                              Bbsus4  Bb
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
     Gm                               Cm7
Give in this time and show me some affection
      Eb                               Bbsus4  Bb
We're going for those pleasures in the night


[Pre-Chorus]
          Am                  Gm           Dm7
I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you
          Am                         Gm
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough
           Cm          Dm             F
And if you move real slow I'll let it go


[Chorus]
         Gm                       Eb
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
Eb                   F                   Gm
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
         Gm                      Eb
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
    Eb                  F
And I know, I know, I know, I know
         Gm
I know I want you

We shouldn’t even think about tomorrow
      Eb                          Bbsus4  Bb
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
      Gm                               Cm7
We’ll have a good time baby, don’t you worry
       Eb                                          Bb
And if we’re still playing ‘round, boy that’s just fine

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
