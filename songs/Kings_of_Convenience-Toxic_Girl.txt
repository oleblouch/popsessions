[Verse 1]
Emaj7
In the sky the birds are pulling rain
                                  Gmaj7
In your life the curse has got a name
Cmaj7                                 D
Makes you lie awake all through the night
       Emaj7
That's why

[Verse 2]
Emaj7
She's intoxicated by herself
                                   Gmaj7
Everyday she's seen with someone else
Cmaj7                               D
And every night she kisses someone new
       Emaj7
Never you
N.C.

[Verse 3]
Emaj7
You're waiting in the shadows for a chance
                                          Gmaj7
Because you believe at heart that if you can
Cmaj7                          D
Show to her what love is all about
         Emaj7
She'll change
N.C.

[Verse 4]
                                      Emaj7
She'll talk to you with no one else around
                                 Gmaj7   
But only if you're able to entertain her
    Cmaj7                            D
The moment conversation stops she's gone
   Am
Again
N.C.

[Outro]
Emaj7
       Cmaj7                          D
She's gonna be the heart that if you can
        Cmaj7                   D
She'll change her heart if you can
         Cmaj7                           D
But the moment conversation stops she's gone
  Emaj7
Again
Emaj7
