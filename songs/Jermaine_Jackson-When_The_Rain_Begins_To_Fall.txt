AND WHEN THE RAIN BEGINS TO FALL
================================
by Jermaine Jackson & Pia Zadora


[Verse 1]

   Em                           Am                   D
   Like the sand can seep right through your fingers so can all your days
   Em                      Am               D
   As those days go by you have me there to help you find
   Em                        Am              D
   The way I feel with you I know it's gonna last forever


[Chorus]

   Em           Am             D
   And when the rain begins to fall
              Bm             Em
   You are my rainbow in the sky
              Am               D
   And I will catch you if you fall
             Bm             Em
   You never have to ask me why
                Am             D
   And when the rain begins to fall
               Bm               Em
   I'll be the sunshine in your life
                 Am             D
   You know that we can have it all
                             Em
   And everything will be allright


[Verse 2]

   Em                          Am            D                  Em
   Time goes by so fast you've got to have a dream to just hold on
                           Am             D
   All my dreams of love began with the reality of
   Em                     Am                  D
   You and I believe that all the dreams will last forever

   Em           Am             D
   And when the rain begins to fall
              Bm             Em
   You are my rainbow in the sky
              Am               D
   And I will catch you if you fall
             Bm             Em
   You never have to ask me why
                Am             D
   And when the rain begins to fall
               Bm               Em
   I'll be the sunshine in your life
                 Am             D
   You know that we can have it all
                             Em
   And everything will be allright


[Bridge]

   Am         D            Bm           C       Am
   Though the sun may hide we still can see the light
        D                  Bm
   that shines for you and me
         C           D               Em
   We'll be together all that we can be


[Chorus]

   Em           Am             D
   And when the rain begins to fall
              Bm             Em
   You are my rainbow in the sky
              Am               D
   And I will catch you if you fall
             Bm             Em
   You never have to ask me why
                Am             D
   And when the rain begins to fall
               Bm               Em
   I'll be the sunshine in your life
                 Am             D
   You know that we can have it all
                             Em
   And everything will be allright
