Ab Cm Fm Eb x2

[Verse 1]
Ab           Eb
It's five o'clock
      Fm               Db    Eb7
and I walk through the empty streets
Ab               Eb
Thoughts fill my head
         Fm
but then still
       Db        Eb7
no one speaks to me
   Ab            Eb
My mind takes me back
       Fm              Db        Eb7
to the years that have passed me by

The night is my friend

To the years that have past me by
