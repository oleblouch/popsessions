[Intro]

| A       | A/G     | A/F#    | A/F     |


[Verse 1]

A           A/G       A/F#      A/F
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
     A         A/G       A/F#      A/F
with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
A              A/G      A/F#         A/F
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
  A            A/G       F#m      Dm    Dm/C
a girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Bb                    C
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
F                  Bb
towering over your head
C                          G
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
          D
and she's gone


[Chorus]

G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah.


[Verse 2]

A          A/G       A/F#        A/F
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
      A             A/G        A/F#        A/F
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
A               A/G     A/F#           A/F
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
     A       A/G        F#m    Dm   Dm/C
that grow so incredibly high
Bb                C
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
F                   Bb
waiting to take you away
C                           G
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
           D
and you're gone


[Chorus]

G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah.

A           A/G       A/F#       A/F
Picture yourself on a train in a station
     A          A/G           A/F#          A/F
With Plasticine porters with looking-glass ties
A        A/G        A/F#         A/F
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
A                A/G       F#m
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D         D     A
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ahhh. Ahh
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
G           C        D         D    A
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ahh. Ahhh
