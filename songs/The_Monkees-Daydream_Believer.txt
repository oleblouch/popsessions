[Verse 1]

            G               Am
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
       Bm             C
Of the bluebird as it sings
    G            Em               A7     D7
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
       G           Am
But it rings and I rise
         Bm              C
Wash the sleep out of my eyes
   G       Em      Am   D7     G
My shaving razor's cold and it stings


[Chorus]

C        D      Bm
Cheer up sleepy Jean
C       D      Em   C
Oh what can it mean to a
G            C            G     Em         A7       D7
  Daydream believer and a    ho-ome coming quee -ee-een


[Verse 2]

G                   Am
You once thought of me
     Bm                C
As a white knight on a steed
G                Em
Now you know how happy
      A7    D7
I can be
        G                    Am
And our good times start and end
        Bm            C
Without dollar one to spend
    G        Em   Am    D7     G
But how much baby do we really need


[Chorus]

C        D      Bm
Cheer up sleepy Jean
C       D      Em   C
Oh what can it mean to a
G            C            G     Em         A7    D7
  Daydream believer and a    ho-ome coming quee--een
