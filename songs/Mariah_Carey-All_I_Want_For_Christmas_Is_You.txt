G
I don't want a lot for Christmas

there is just one thing I need

Eb
underneath the Christmas tree 
G
I just want you for my own 
Em                  Eb
more than you could ever know

[Verse 1]

G
I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need 
C                               Eb
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree 
G
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace 
C                               Eb
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas day 


[Hook]

G                           Em                       Eb
I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know 
G                  E7      Am             D
Make my wish come true...  All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby 

G Em C D


[Verse 2]

G
I won't ask for much this Christmas, I won't even wish for snow 
C                              Eb
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe 
G
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick 
C                          Eb
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click 


[Hook]

G                                    Em                   Eb
'Cause I just want you here tonight, holding on to me so tight 
G               E7        Am             D
What more can I do, baby  All I want for Christmas is you, you baby 

G Em C D


[Bridge]

B                          Em
All the lights are shining brightly everywhere 
B                         Em
And the sound of children laughter fills the air 
Eb                       G              E7
and everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Am
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need 
          D
Won't you please bring my baby to me 


[Hook]

G
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas, this is all I'm asking for 
C                          Eb
I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door 
G                              Em                        Eb
Oh I just want him for my own, more than you could ever know 
G                  E7   Am             D
Make my wish come true, all I want for Christmas is you...


[Outro]

G Em C D
