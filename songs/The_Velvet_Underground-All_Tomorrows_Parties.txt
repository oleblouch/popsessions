[Chorus]
D                      C        G    D
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
G      Em         A
To all tomorrow's parties?

[Verse 1]
D                         C   G     D
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
G      Em         A
To all tomorrow's parties
G                         A
And where will she go and what shall she do
G                   A
When midnight comes around
       D                 C  G     D
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
G       A          D
And cry behind the door

(solo en D)

[Chorus]
D                      C        G    D
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
G      Em         A
To all tomorrow's parties

[Verse 2]
D                       C     G     D
Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
G      Em         A
To all tomorrow's parties
G                         A
And what will she do with Thursday's rags
G                   A
When Monday comes around
       D                 C  G     D
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
G       A          D
And cry behind the door

(solo en D)

[Chorus]
D                      C        G    D
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
G      Em         A
To all tomorrow's parties

[Verse 3]
D                       C  G     D
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
G        Em           A
For whom none will go mourning
G                     A
A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
G                  A
Of rags and silks, a costume
        D       C    G   D
Fit for one who sits and cries
G       A          D
For all tomorrow's parties

(solo en D)
