[Verse 1]
C                          G
Baby Jane,  don't leave me hanging on the line,
        Am                    F  Am      F    G
    I knew you when you had no one to talk to.
     C                    G
    Now you're moving in high society,
     Am                   F  Am     F    G
    don't forget I know secrets about you.
F                             G
    I used to think you were on my side,
         F                 G
    but now I'm no longer sure.
F                      Am               G
    I wish I knew what I know now - before.

[Chorus]
      Am             G               F                Am      G
    When I give my heart again, I know,  it's gonna last forever.
     Am               G                F                Am      G
    No one tell me where or when, I know,  it's gonna last forever.

[Verse 2]
  C                   G
 Baby Jane, don't it make you feel sad,
     Am                        F  Am    F  G
    just when I thought that we were winning.
     C                  G
    You and I were so close in every way,
      Am                         F Am        F   G
    don't time fly when you're loving and laughing.
F                         G
    I've said goodbye so many times,
         F                        G
    the situation ain't all that new.
F                  Am                        G
    Optimism's my best defense, I'll get through without you.

[Chorus]
  Am              G              F               Am      G
When I give my heart again, I know,  it's gonna last forever.
 Am               G                F               Am      G
No one tell me where or when, I know,  it's gonna last forever.
Am               G              F               Am      G
I won't be that dumb again, I know, it's gotta last forever.
 Am              G              F               Am      G
When I fall in love again, I know, it's gonna last forever.

[Verse 3]
  C                     G
 Baby Jane,  I've said all I want to say,
     Am                       F     Am     F    G
    go your own way, don't think twice about me.
             C                   G
     Â´Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own,
     Am                     F    Am       F     G
    so long darlin', I'll miss you,  believe me.
F                              G
    The lesson learned was so hard to swallow,
        F                    G
    but I know that I'll survive,
F                           Am                 G
    I'm gonna take a good look at myself and cry.

[Chorus]
  Am              G              F               Am      G
When I give my heart again, I know,  it's gonna last forever.
 Am               G                F               Am      G
No one tell me where or when, I know,  it's gonna last forever.
Am               G              F               Am      G
I won't be that dumb again, I know, it's gotta last forever.
 Am              G              F               Am      G
When I fall in love again, I know, it's gonna last forever.
