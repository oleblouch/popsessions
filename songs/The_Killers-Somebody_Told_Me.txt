[Intro]

Am   Dm


[Verse]

Am
Breaking my back just to know your name
                                            Dm      F
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
Am
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
Am
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Am                                 Dm           F
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss
Am
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
Am
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
 F                   G                    Am
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
 F                       G
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight


[Chorus]

              Am
Well somebody told me
           F
You had a boyfriend
                   G
Who looked like a girlfriend
               E            Am
That I had in February of last year
          F
It's not confidential
          G
I've got potential


[Verse]

Am
Ready? Let's roll onto something new
                                               Dm     F
Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you
Am
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
Am
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
F                                  G      Am
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
F                         G
Never thought I'd let a rumour ruin my moonlight


[Chorus]

              Am
Well somebody told me
           F
You had a boyfriend
                   G
Who looked like a girlfriend
               E            Am
That I had in February of last year
          F
It's not confidential
          G
I've got potential
                  E
A rushin', a rushin' around


[Bridge]

F         G         Dm
Pace yourself from me
        C    Dm      F
I said maybe baby please
                 Am       G     F
But I just don't know now
   E                              G
When all I wanna do is try


[Chorus]

              Am
Well somebody told me
           F
You had a boyfriend
                   G
Who looked like a girlfriend
               E            Am
That I had in February of last year
          F
It's not confidential
          G
I've got potential
                  E
A rushin', a rushin' around

              Am
Well somebody told me
           F
You had a boyfriend
                   G
Who looked like a girlfriend
               E            Am
That I had in February of last year
          F
It's not confidential
          G
I've got potential
                  E
A rushin', a rushin' around

              Am
Well somebody told me
           F
You had a boyfriend
                   G
Who looked like a girlfriend
               E            Am
That I had in February of last year
          F
It's not confidential
          G
I've got potential
                  E
A rushin', a rushin' around

Am
