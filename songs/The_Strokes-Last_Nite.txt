[Verse 1]
C
Last night she said
             Dm
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
       G
Oh, it turns me off
        Em        Dm
When I feel left out"
   C
So I, I turned around
          Dm
Oh, baby, don't care no more
       G
I know this for sure
       Em              Dm
I'm walking out that door
C
Well, I've been in town

For just 'bout fifteen minutes now
            Dm
Oh, baby, I feel so down
      G
And I don't know why
        Em           Dm
I keep walking for miles


[Chorus]
 F                        G
But the people they don't understand
 F                          G
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
 F                         G
Your grandsons, they won't understand
 F                                 G
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

C
Last night she said
             Dm
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
       G
Oh, it turns me off
        Em        Dm
When I feel left out"
   C
So I, I turned around
          Dm
Oh, baby, gonna be alright
         G
It was a great big lie
      Em           Dm
As I left that night, yeah

[Chorus]
    F                  G
Oh, people they don't understand
    F                       G
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
    F                     G
In spaceships, they won't understand
    F                      G
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

When I feel left out"

So I, I turned around
                   Dm
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
       G
I know this for sure
            Em       Dm
I'm walking out that door, yeah
