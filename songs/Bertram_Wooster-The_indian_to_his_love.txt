THE INDIAN TO HIS LOVE by: William Butler Yeats (1865-1939)

    |Bm7
The island dreams under the dawn
				|Em9		
And great boughs drop tranquillity;
The peahens dance on a smooth lawn,		(la(/Bb) - sib - la - sol - fa#(A) - sol
			Bm7
A parrot sways upon a tree,
	      |A6			 |Gmaj7
Raging at his own image in the enamelled sea.
 
     |Bm7
Here we will moor our lonely ship
		     |	   |Em9
And wander ever with woven hands,
Murmuring softly lip to lip,
Along the grass, along the sands,
	      |A6		       |Gmaj7
Murmuring how far away are the unquiet lands:
 
    |Bm7
How we alone of mortals are
			|Em9
Hid under quiet boughs apart,
While our love grows an Indian star,
			|Bm7
A meteor of the burning heart,
	     |A6					|Gmaj7
One with the tide that gleams, the wings that gleam and dart,
 
Bridge : D - Bm7 - Bbmaj7 (x?) Em - Cmaj7 - Bm7

    |Bm7
The heavy boughs, the burnished dove
				|Em9
That moans and sighs a hundred days:
How when we die our shades will rove,
				  |Bm7
When eve has hushed the feathered ways,
	     |A6	     |		    |Gmaj7
With vapoury footsole by the water's drowsy blaze.
