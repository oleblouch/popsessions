[Verse 1]
       Cm
Such a shame
     Ab         Fm
To believe in escape
                  Cm
'A laugh on every face'
             Ab
But that's a change
Fm                               
  Until I'm finally left with an '8'

[Bridge]
Gm/C               Gm9 
  Tell me to relax - I just stare
Gm/C                Gm9         
  Maybe I don't know if I should change
Gm/C                Asus4          Dm
  A feeling that we share - It's a shame

[Chorus]
| Dm | Bb/D | C | % |
               (Such a shame)
Dm             Bb/D
Number me with rage
       C
It's a shame (such a shame)
Dm             Bb/D        C
Number me in haste (such a shame)
     C            Bb
This eagerness to change

[Verse 2]
| Cm | Ab | Fm                     Cm
                The dice decide my fate
         Ab
That’s a shame
Fm                           
  In these trembling hands my faith

[Bridge]
Gm/C               Gm9       
  Tells me to react, "I don't care"
Gm/C             Gm9            
  Maybe it's unkind if I should change
Gm/C                Asus4          Dm
  A feeling that we share - It's a shame

     C            Bb
This eagerness to change
