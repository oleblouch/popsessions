Refrain :
C				D7/F#
Maybe someday we'll be together
		F
Holding onto words that bind us

C
Drawn to
		F
Moves that linger
		Bdim
Reaching outward
		E7
To those around me


Couplets : Dm  G7  Cmaj7 Fmaj7  Bdim   E7
Dm			G7
Filling spaces		 Of voids that gather
Cmaj7			Fmaj7
Staring into		Eyes that capture
Bdim 					E7
Wanting	More than ever	To be here forever



Dm			G7
Take me into		Worlds where you are
Cmaj7			Fmaj7	
Living freely	I want to   hear you (Touch me)
Bdim						E7
Where time breaks (Knowingly) after    reaching (onto) floating noises
