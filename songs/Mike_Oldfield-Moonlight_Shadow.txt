[Verse 1]
    Am                 F
The last that ever she saw him
G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
   Am                    F
He passed on worried and warning
G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
C                     G
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Am   F          G
Far away on the other side.
       C                         G
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
        Am            F           G
And she couldn't find how to push through

[Verse 2]
    Am                        F
The trees that whisper in the evening
G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
       Am                 F
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
C                 G
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Am  F           G
Far away on the other side.
       C                   G
He was shot six times by a man on the run
        Am            F           G
And she couldn't find how to push through

[Bridge]
C   G
  I stay
C   G
  I pray
  C          F      G
I see you in heaven far away
C   G
  I stay
C   G
  I pray
  C          F      G
I see you in heaven   One day

[Verse 3]
Am             F
Four am in the morning
G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
  Am                  F
I watched your vision forming
G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
C                   G
Star was light in a silvery night
Am  F           G
Far away on the other side
         C               G
Will you come to talk to me this night
        Am            F           G
But she couldn't find how to push through

[Bridge]
C   G
  I stay
C   G
  I pray
  C          F      G
I see you in heaven far away
C   G
  I stay
C   G
  I pray
  C          F      G
I see you in heaven   One day

[Solo]
Am F G
 
Am  F           G
Far away on the other side.
 
Am F G
 
[Ending]
C                         G
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
    C                       G
The night was heavy but the air was alive
        Am            F           G
But she couldn't find how to push through
                  C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
                  C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Am  F           G
Far away on the other side.
