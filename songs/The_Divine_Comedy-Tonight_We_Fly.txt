[Verse 1]
G D          Am    Em
Tonight we fly
C        G           D               B
Over the houses, the streets and the trees
Em       G         C
Over the dogs down below
        Em          Am
They'll bark at our shadows
   C        D7        G
As we float by on the breeze


[Verse 2]
G D          Am    Em
Tonight we fly
C        G             D                B
Over the chimney tops, skylights and slates
Em          G         C
Looking into all your lives
    Em          Am
And wondering why
C         D7              G
Happiness is so hard to find


[Chorus]
G        D       Am        Em
Over the doctor, over the soldier
C        G       D        B
Over the farmer, over the poacher
Em          G       C        Em
Over the preacher, over the gambler
Am       C
Over the teacher,
G        D              Am
Over the wri-, over the writer
Em       C
Over the lawyer,
G        D        B        Em
over the dancer , Over the voyeur
G        C       Em      Am
Over the builder and the destroyer
C        D7            G
Over the hills and far away


[Verse 3]
G D          Am    Em
Tonight we fly
C        G           D               B
Over the mountains, the beach and the sea
Em       G         C
Over the friends that we've known
        Em          Am
And those that we now know
   C                D7     G
And those who we've yet to meet


[Verse 4]
G D          Am    Em
And when we die
  C            G         D          B
Oh, will we be that disappointed or sad?
Em       G        C
If heaven doesn't exist
     Em           Am
What will we have missed?
   C             D7              G
This life is the best we've ever had
