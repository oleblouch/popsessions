[Verse 1]

D                                           A6
If you, if you could return, don't let it burn, don't let it fade.
                        C        CM7                     C CM7
I'm sure I'm not being rude, but it's just your attitude,
                     G
It's tearing me apart, It's ruining everything.
      D                                              A6
I swore, I swore I would be true, and honey, so did you.
                               C        CM7                 C  
So why were you holding her hand? Is that the way we stand?
         CM7                 G
Were you lying all the time? Was it just a game to you?

[Chorus]

                 D                         A6
But I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you.
                               C       CM7         C
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha.
        CM7              G    
Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to,
                          D
Do you have to let it linger?

[Refrain]:
     A6                                    C       CM7           C
Oh, I thought the world of you, I thought nothing could go wrong,
CM7            G
But I was wrong, I was wrong,

[Verse 2]
D                                          A6
If you, if you could get by, trying not to lie,
                      C            CM7                     C
Things wouldn't be so confused and I wouldn't feel so used,
          CM7         G
But you always really knew, I just wanna be with you.

[Chorus]
                 D                      A6
But I'm in so deep, You know I'm such a fool for you,
                                  C    CM7
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha.
C       CM7             G
Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to,
                        D
Do you have to let it linger?
                 D                      A6
But I'm in so deep, You know I'm such a fool for you,
                                  C    CM7
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha.
C       CM7             G
Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to,
                        D
Do you have to let it linger?
                 D                      A6
But I'm in so deep, You know I'm such a fool for you,
                                  C    CM7
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha.
C       CM7             G
Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to,
                        D
Do you have to let it linger?
