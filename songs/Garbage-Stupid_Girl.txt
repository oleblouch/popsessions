NOTES:
1.  This my own interpretation of this song.  Although, it fits the essential simplicity of the 
song structure, the compositional reviews and the tuning.
2.  "…"Stupid Girl" is a moderately alternative rock fast song with touches of electronica, 
set in common time. It is built on a I-IV change in F#, with both chords, F#7 and B7.  The tonal 
function of a "dominant" seventh chord is to resolve up a perfect fourth. In non-classical harmony, 
the chord is often used similarly, but also, especially in blues, funk, and early rock music, 
it is used commonly for its colour that seems to mesh major and minor together with its major third, 
minor seventh, and the dissonant interval between the two. When the F#7 chord is played, it should 
traditionally resolve to B, which would expectedly be a B major 7th chord, the M7 being the major 
3rd of the tonic. …"
