Hope the solo makes sense, I couldn't get it to sound right using full chords for the D and C but I
think it sounds fine using the bass notes. You can play along with the track using open chords or
you could experiment by playing the chords in different positions further up the neck.
Any comments, (especially on the solo), are very welcome. Please rate.

[Intro]
D

[Verse 1]
       D             D               D              D
We are young, we run green, keep our teeth nice and clean
        Em               Em             D    D
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright

[Verse 2]
        D         D            D           D
We wake up, we go out, smoke a fag, put it out
        Em               Em             D    D
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright

[Chorus]
F#m                F
Are we like you, I can't be sure
       Em           Em           A              A
Of the scene as she turns we are strange in our hearts

[Verse 3]
           D             D            D              D
But we are young, we get by, can't go mad, ain't got time

Sleep around if we like but we're alright

[Verse 4]
         D                 D               D               D
Got some cash, bought some wheels, took it out, 'cross the fields
         Em         Em                D    D
Lost control, did a roll, but we're alright

[Chorus]
F#m                F
Are we like you, I can't be sure  
       Em           Em           A              A
Of the scene as she turns we are strange in our hearts

[Verse 4]
           D             D               D              D
But we are young, we run green, keep our teeth nice and clean
        Em               Em            D    D
See our friends, see the sights feel alright

Of the scene, as she turns, we are strange in our hearts

[Verse 5]
           D             D               D              D
