Asus2         Am           Asus2     Am
She leaned herself against a fence
Asus2        Am          Dsus2   Dm
Just for a kiss or two
Dsus2              Dm     Dsus2    Dm
And with a little pen-knife held in her hand
Dsus2     Dm           Asus2   Am
She plugged him through and through

Come take him by his feet
Dsus2              Dm     Dsus2    Dm
And throw him in this deep deep well
Dsus2     Dm           Asus2   Am
Which is more than one hundred feet
