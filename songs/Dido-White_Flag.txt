[Intro]

F    Am    x3


[Verse 1]

Dm
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
     Am
I'll tell you that
       Dm
But if I didn't say it

Well, I'd still have felt it
Am
Where's the sense in that?


[Pre-Chorus 1]

          C
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
     Gm                     Am
Or return to where we were


[Chorus]

Bb                           F
  But I will go down with this ship
            Gm                     Dm
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                    F
There will be no white flag above my door
       C             Gm
I'm in love and always will be


[Verse 2]

Dm
I know I left too much mess
                        Am
And destruction to come back again
             Dm
And I caused nothing but trouble
                          Am
I understand if you can't talk to me again


[Pre-Chorus 2]

C
  And if you live by the rules of "It's over"
         Gm                          Am
Then I'm sure that that makes sense


[Chorus]

Bb                           F
  And I will go down with this ship
            Gm                     Dm
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                    F
There will be no white flag above my door
       C             Gm
I'm in love and always will be


[Bridge]

            F
And when we meet

As I'm sure we will
             Am
All that was then

Will be there still
            Gm
I'll let it pass

And hold my tongue
             C
And you will think

That I've moved on


[Chorus]

Bb                       F
  I will go down with this ship
            Gm                     Dm
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                    F
There will be no white flag above my door
       C             Gm
I'm in love and always will be

Bb                       F
  I will go down with this ship
            Gm                     Dm
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                    F
There will be no white flag above my door
       C             Gm
I'm in love and always will be


[Chorus/Ending] (one strum only or piano)

Bb                       F
  I will go down with this ship
            Gm                     Dm
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                    F
There will be no white flag above my door
       C             Gm
I'm in love and always will be
