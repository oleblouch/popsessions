Info : le C/B n'est qu'un accord de passage, en fait on reste toujours 8 temps sur le C d'avant.

[Intro]
| C |

[Verse 1]
C                                       C/B    Am
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
       G
I have squandered my resistance
      G7           G6               C
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
    C/B      Am           G                 F
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   C      G    F G C (8 temps)
And disregards the rest

       C                                     C/B    Am
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
       G
In the company of strangers
       G7         G6              C
In the quiet of a railway station running scared
C/B    Am          G              
Laying low seeking out the poorer 
F                                C
quarters where the ragged people go
        G              F    G          C
Looking for the places only they would know


[Refrain]
       Am
Lie-la-lie
       Em
Lie-la-la-la-la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
       G                           C
Lie-la la la la la lie la la la la lie


[Verse 2]
       C                                  C/B   Am
Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job
             G
But I get no offers
       G7               G6                C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
  C/B  Am               G                
I do declare there were times when I was 
F                               C
so lonesome I took some comfort there
      G               C
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3]
         C                                        C/B   Am
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
      G              G7            G6             C
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Em          Am
 Leading me-e
      G7      C
Going home

       C                                     C/B    Am
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
       G
And he carries the reminders
   G7               G6               C
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him till he cried out
             C/B     Am
In his anger and his shame
      G             F                                 C
"I am leaving, I am leaving." but the fighter still remains
        G       F G C
Hm, hm, hm

Lie-la-la-la-la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
       G                          [ Am ]
Lie-la la la la la lie la la la la lie

Am          Em
     Lie-la-la-la-la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
       G                          [ C ]
Lie-la la la la la lie la la la la lie
