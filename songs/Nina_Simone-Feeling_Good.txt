Capo 3rd Fret


[Verse]

Em           Em7/D      C7         B7       
Birds flying high you know how I feel
Em           Em7/D      C7         B7       
Sun in the sky you know how I feel
Em           Em7/D      C7         B7       
Reeds driftin’ on by you know how I feel


[Chorus]

Em
It’s a new dawn
Em7/D
It’s a new day
C7 
It’s a new life

F-o-r     me
And I’m feeling good

[Verse]

Em          Em7/D     C7         B7       
Fish in the sea you know how I feel
Em            Em7/D       C7        B7       
River running free you know how I feel
Em             Em7/D      C7         B7       
Blossom in the tree you know how I feel


[Chorus]

Em
It’s a new dawn

[Verse]

Em                   Em7/D     C7          B7       
Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don’t you know
Em                     Em7/D     C7         B7       
Butterflies all havin’ fun you know what I mean
Em       Em7/D        C7     B7       
Sleep in peace when day is done

That’s what I mean


[Chorus]

Em
And this old world
Em7/D
Is a new world
C7 
And a bold world
B7        
F-o-r     me

Em           Em7/D      C7         B7       

Em             Em7/D       C7         B7       
Stars when you shine you know how I feel
Em           Em7/D      C7         B7       
Scent of the pine you know how I feel
Em            Em7/D        C7         B7       
Oh freedom is mine and I know how I feel

Em       Em7/D        C7     B7       

Em
It’s a new dawn
Em7/D
It’s a new day
C7 
It’s a new life
B7        A B   
F-o-r     me
And I’m feeling good

Em           Em7/D      C7         B7
