[Intro]
G      G      A      A
D7     D7     D7     D7

[Verse 1]
     G                                   D
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
       G              A                 D
with a pink hotel, a boutique and a swingin' hot spot.

[Chorus]
D               Dmaj7
Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
     G                  A                D
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

[Interlude]
D

[Verse 2]
     G                                        D
They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
         G                    A                         D
and they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.

[Chorus]
D               Dmaj7
Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
     G                  A                D
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

[Interlude]
D

[Verse 3]
G                                     D
Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T. now,
        G                      A                          D
give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please.

[Chorus 3]
D               Dmaj7
Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
     G                  A                D
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

[Interlude]
D

[Verse 4]
G                                       D
Late last night I heard the screen door slam
      G               A                D
and a big yellow taxi took away my old man

[Chorus]
D               Dmaj7
Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
     G                  A                D     D
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

D               Dmaj7
Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
     G                  A                D
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

[Outro]
D         G               A                D
Yeah they paved paradise, put up a parking lot
D           G               A                D
I said they paved paradise, put up a parking lot
