Em  G  Em  G  Bm  C  Em


[Verse 1]

Em              G
Swinging in the backyard
Em              G
Pull up in your fast car
Bm           C
Whistling my name

Em        G
Open up a beer
        Em           G
And you say get over here
           Bm    C   Em
And play a video game

    Em              G
I'm in his favorite sundress
Em              G
Watching me get undressed
Bm             C
Take that body downtown

Em            G
I say you the bestest
Em            G
Lean in for a big kiss
Bm               C       Em
Put his favorite perfume on
          Bm    C
Go play a video game


[Pre-Chorus]

     D                   Dsus4
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
             D
Everything I do


[Chorus]

                   C
I tell you all the time
                                G
Heaven is a place on earth with you
                            F    Em
Tell me all the things you wanna do

I heard that you like the bad girls
C
Honey, is that true?

C                               G
  It's better than I ever even knew
                             F        Em
They say that the world was built for two
                         C              Ebaug
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
                  Em
And baby, now you do

[Verse 2]

Em             G
Singing in the old bars
Em                G
Swinging with the old stars
Bm             C
Living for the fame

Em             G
Kissing in the blue dark
Em               G
Playing pool and wild darts
Bm    C   Em
Video games

   Em              G
He holds me in his big arms
Em             G
Drunk and I am seeing stars
Bm            C
This is all I think of

Em               G
Watching all our friends fall
Em            G
In and out of Old Paul's
Bm          C      Em
This is my idea of fun
        Bm    C
Playing video games


[Pre-Chorus]

     D                   Dsus4
It's you, it's you, it's all for you

Everything I do
