[Chorus]

 Em                       Am        D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  Singing my life with his words.
 Em                      Am                       D        C
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Fmaj7#11           E
Killing me softly,  with his song.


[Verse]

Am7        D
I heard he sang a good song.
G          C
I heard he had a style.
Am7        D
And so I came to see him,
    Em
and listen for a while.
Am7          D7
And there he was this young boy,
G          B7
a stranger to my eyes.


[Chorus]

 Em                       Am        D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  Singing my life with his words.
 Em                      Am                      D        C
Killing me softly with his song. Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Fmaj7#11           E
Killing me softly,  with his song.


[Verse]

Am7        D
I felt all flushed with fever,
G          C
embarrassed by the crowd.
Am7        D
I felt he found my letters
    Em
and read each one out loud.
Am7          D7
I prayed that he would finish,
G          B7
but he just kept right on.


[Chorus]

 Em                       Am        D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  Singing my life with his words.
 Em                      Am                       D        C
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Fmaj7#11           E
Killing me softly,  with his song.
