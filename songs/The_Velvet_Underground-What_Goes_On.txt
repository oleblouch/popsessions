[Verse]
          D            D
What goes on in your mind
             C    G      D
I think that  I am falling down
          D            D
What goes on in your mind
            C    G     D
I think that I am upside down

[Chorus]
        A                 G
Lady be good, do what you should
                D               D
You know it'll work all right
         A                 G
Lady be good, do what you should
                D          D 
You know it'll be all right

[Verse]
          D                 D
I'm goin' up, and I'm goin' down
          C       G        D
I'm gonna fly from side to side
        D               D
See the bells up in the sky
        C       G       D
Somebody cut the string in two

[Chorus]
        A                 G
Lady be good, do what you should

Lady be good, do what you should
                D          D 
You know it'll be all right

[Verse]
           D           D
One minute one, and one minute two
           C       G        D
One minute up, and one minute down
           D           D
What goes on in your mind
            C    G      D
I think that I am falling down

You know it'll work all right

Lady be good, do what you should
                D          D 
You know it'll be all right
