    E     C#m*                D
Now I've, had, the time of my life
                             E
No, I never felt like this before
        C#m            D
Yes, I, swear it's the truth
                    E
and I owe it all to you
       E     C#m                 D
'Cause I've, had, the time of my life
                    E
and I owe it all to you

          D
I've been waiting for so long,
         
now I've finally found someone
            E
to stand by me
           D
We saw the writing on the wall,
                             E
as we felt this magical fantasy
         D
Now with passion in our eyes,
                                          E
there's no way we could disguise it secretly
      D
So we take each other's hand,

'Cause we seem to understand
         E
the urgency (just remember)

A 
 You're the one thing,
G
 I can't get enough of
A
 So I'll tell you something,
B7 *
 this could be love because 
 
    E     C#m                 D
Now I've, had, the time of my life
                             E
No, I never felt like this before
        C#m            D
Yes, I, swear it's the truth
                    E
and I owe it all to you

        D
With my body and soul
                                 E
I want you more than you'll ever know
         D
So we'll just let it go,
                            E
don't be afraid to lose control
      D
Yes I know what's on your mind,
                   
when you say, "Stay with me
  E
tonight." (just remember) 

A 
 You're the one thing,
G
 I can't get enough of
A
 So I'll tell you something,

Yes, I, swear it's the truth
                    E
and I owe it all to you
