[Intro]

C (palm mute)
Jitterbug [4X]


[Verse 1]

            C
You put the boom-boom into my heart
            Dm                      C
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
C
Jitterbug into my brain
       Dm                     C
Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same

    Dm
But something's bugging you
Em
Something ain't right
   F                        Em
My best friend told me what you did last night
Dm               Em
Left me sleepin' in my bed
F                     G
I was dreaming, but I should have been with you instead.


[Chorus]

N.C.    C
Wake me up before you go-go 
                Dm                C
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
        C
Wake me up before you go-go
                 Dm                        C
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
        C
Wake me up before you go-go
                Dm                C
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
        C
Wake me up before you go-go
Em      Dm         C9  F/C  C7
Take me dancing tonight
                  C9  F/C  C7
I wanna hit that high      (yeah, yeah)


[Verse 2]

             C
You take the grey skies out of my way
             Dm                      C
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
         C
Turned a bright spark into a flame
   Dm                      C
My beats per minute never been the same

       Dm              Em
'Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool
   F                   Em
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Dm             Em
Come on, baby, let's not fight
F                 G
We'll go dancing, everything will be all right

                 Dm                        C
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high

Wake me up before you go-go
                Dm                C
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
