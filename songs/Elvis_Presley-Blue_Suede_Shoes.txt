Well, it's one for the money,

Two for the show,

Three to get ready,
    A7
Now go, cat, go.
    D                               A
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
        E               D                        A
You can do anything but lay off of my Blue suede shoes.

              A
Well, you can knock me down,

Step in my face,

Slander my name

All over the place.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
       A7
Honey, lay off of my shoes

Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

A D E7 A

        A
You can burn my house,

Steal my car,

Drink my liquor

From an old fruitjar.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
       A7
Honey, lay off of my shoes
D                               A
Don't you step on my Blue suede shoes.
              E               D                        A
Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.
