[Verse]
E
Get your motor runnin'

Head out on the highway

Lookin' for adventure

And whatever comes our way

[Chorus]
G      A             E
Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
G         A          E
Take the world in a love embrace
G     A           E              G    A          E
Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space

[Verse]
E
I like smoke and lightnin'

Heavy metal thunder

Racin' with the wind

And the feelin' that I'm under

[Chorus]
G      A              E
Yeah, darlin', gonna make it happen
G         A          E
Take the world in a love embrace
G     A           E              G    A          E
Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space

[Bridge]
        E
Like a true nature's child
         G
We were born, born to be wild
        A            G              E
We can climb so high, I never wanna die
 E          D    E    D
Born to be wild
 E          D    E    D
Born to be wild
