The Bee Gees  1967 (Bee Gees' 1st)

D A Am 

Am                  G F           Am
Ooh you're a holiday,  such a holiday
                    G F           Am  G
Ooh you're a holiday,  such a holiday

     C                        G
It's something I think's worthwhile
       Am               Em
If the puppet makes you smile
   F                        C
If not then you're throwing stones
         G       G7       C
Throwing stones, throwing stones

Am                   
Ooh it's a funny game
      G F                       Am 
Don't believe that it's all the same
                               
Can't think what I've just said
    G   F                 Am    G
Put the soft pillow on my head

C                    G
Millions of eyes can see
    Am          Em
Yet why am I so blind
F                        C
When the someone else is me
       G    G7       C
It's unkind,  it's unkind

Am                         F        Am
De de de de de de de de de de de de de
                           F        Am  G
De de de de de de de de de de de de de

C                    G
Millions of eyes can see
    Am          Em
Yet why am I so blind
F                        C
When the someone else is me
       G    G7       C
It's unkind,  it's unkind

Am                    G     F               Am
Ooh you re a holiday, every day, such a holiday
                              G F            Am      G
Now it s my turn to say,  and I say you're a holiday

     C                        G
It's something I think's worthwhile
       Am               Em
If the puppet makes you smile
   F                        C
If not then you're throwing stones
         G       G7       C
Throwing stones, throwing stones

Am                         F        Am
De de de de de de de de de de de de de
                           F        Am  
De de de de de de de de de de de de de
