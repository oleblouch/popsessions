[Intro]
Am Dsus2 Fmaj7 G

[Verse]
Am            Dsus2
Is it getting better
Fmaj7             G
Or do you feel the same
Am            Dsus2
Will it make it easier on you
Fmaj7                  G
Now you got someone to blame, You say

[Chorus]
C          Am
  One love,  One life,
Fmaj7                 C
  When it's one need,  in the night
C                 Am
  One love, We got to share it
Fmaj7                C
  It leaves you baby, if you don't care for it

Am Dsus2 Fmaj7 G

[Verse]
Am             Dsus2
  Did I disappoint you?
Fmaj7                             G
  Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
Am                      Dsus2
  You act like you never had love
Fmaj7                       G
  And you want me to go without, Well it's

[Bridge]
C           Am
  Too late,    Tonight
Fmaj7                    C
  To drag the past out into the light
C                       Am
  We're one, but we're not the same
           Fmaj7               C
We got to carry each other carry each other
   Am   Dsus2   Fmaj7   G
One

[Verse]
Am                        Dsus2
Have you come here for forgiveness
         Fmaj7                  G
Have you come to raise the dead
Am                         Dsus2
Have you come here to play Jesus
       Fmaj7               G
To the lepers in your head

[Bridge]
C                    Am
  Did I ask too much,   More than a lot
Fmaj7                           C
  You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
C                      Am
  We're one, but we're not the same
        Fmaj7                    C
Well we hurt each other, then we do it again

[Chorus]
         C                 Am
You say, Love is a temple, Loves a higher law
C                 Am
Love is a temple, Loves the higher law
C                        G
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
    G                  Fmaj7
And I can't be holding on
            Fmaj7                    C
To what you got, When all you got is hurt

[Outro]
C          Am
  One love,   One blood
Fmaj7                  C
  One life, You got to do what you should
C          Am
  One life,  With each other
Fmaj7      C
  Sisters,   Brothers
C                     Am
  One life, But we're not the same
          Fmaj7                 C
We got to carry each other, Carry each other
C    Am     Fmaj7      C
One,         One,
C    Am     Fmaj7      C
One.
C    Am     Fmaj7      C
Hoooho, baby, baby, baby
C    Am     Fmaj7      C
Hoooho, ho ho, ho
C    Am     Fmaj7      C
Hoooho, ho ho, ho
