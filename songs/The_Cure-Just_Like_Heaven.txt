[Verse 1]

                   A               E
"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
    Bm                D
The one that makes me scream" she said
     A                 E
"The one that makes me laugh" she said
    Bm              D
And threw her arms around my neck
 A               E
"Show me how you do it
      Bm             D
And I promise you, I promise that
          A              E
I'll run away with you
          Bm             D
I'll run away with you"

[Verse 2]

A                E
Spinning on that dizzy edge
  Bm                  D
I kissed her face and kissed her head
    A                  E
And dreamed of all the different ways
  Bm              D
I had to make her glow
 A              E               Bm
"Why are you so far away?" she said
               D                     A            E
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
            Bm             D
That I'm in love with you"


[Chorus]

F#m
You
G
 Soft and only
F#m
You
G
 Lost and lonely
F#m
You
G
Strange as angels
D
Dancing in the deepest oceans

Twisting in the water
                   A      E
You're just like a dream
                   Bm     D
You're just like a dream

[Verse 3]

A                  E
Daylight licked me into shape
  Bm              D
I must have been asleep for days
    A              E
And moving lips to breathe her name
  Bm           D
I opened up my eyes
    A             E
And found myself alone, alone
 Bm           D
Alone above a raging sea
     A              E
That stole the only girl I loved
    Bm                 D
And drowned her deep inside of me


[Chorus]

F#m
You
G
Soft and only
F#m
You
G
Lost and lonely
F#m
You
G               D
Just like heaven
