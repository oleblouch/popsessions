INTRO
D/Dm/A/F#7/Bm7/E7/A/E

            A
The more I see you,
           Bm7       E7 
The more I want you
              A
Somehow this feeling
                Bm7   E7 
Just grows and grows
            C7
With every sigh
                  F7 
I become more mad about you
E7          Am         B7        Bm7  E7
More lost without you and so it goes

         A                 Bm7        E7
Can you imagine how much I love you?
            A                  Em   A
The more I see you as years go by
            D              Dm       A   A7  F#7
I know the only one for me can only be you
               Bm7     E7               A    G  A  E7
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

           D
I know the only one for me
Dm       A   A7   F#7 
Can only be you
               Bm7
My arms won't free you,
E7               A   G  A  E7 
My heart won't try
