[Intro]

D **

D           A                      D 
In constant sorrow all through his days 

[Verse 1]

D                      G
I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow 
          A              D *
I've seen trouble all my day. 
                         G
I bid farewell to old Kentucky 
                A              D
The place where I was born and raised. 
                A               D
The place where he was born and raised 

[Verse 2]

D                               G
For six long years I've been in trouble 
             A               D
No pleasures here on earth I found 
                               G
For in this world I'm bound to ramble 
          A                  D
I have no friends to help me now. 
          A                   D
He has no friends to help him now 

[Verse 3]

D                          G
It's fare thee well my old lover 
          A                D
I never expect to see you again 
                                    G
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad 
             A             D
Perhaps I'll die upon this train. 
              A             D
Perhaps he'll die upon this train. 

[Verse 4]

D                            G
You can bury me in some deep valley 
         A                 D
For many years where I may lay 
                            G
Then you may learn to love another 
           A              D
While I am sleeping in my grave. 
            A               D
While he is sleeping in his grave. 

[Verse 5]

D                                   G
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger 
               A            D
My face you'll never see no more. 
                                 G
But there is one promise that is given 
              A               D
I'll meet you on God's golden shore. 
               A               D
He'll meet you on God's golden shore..
