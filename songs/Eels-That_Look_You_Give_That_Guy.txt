Capo V

C C/B Bb A
Dm Dm/C G/B G  (repeat over and over again)

C         G                 Bb      A
I never tought that I could be so bold,
Dm       C                  G
to even say these toughts aloud.
C           G                 Bb         A
I see you with your man, your eyes just shine,
Dm         C                       G
while he stands tall and walking proud.

C              G        Bb      A    Dm
That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
C                 G
Looking right at me.
C          G       Bb        A     Dm
If I could be that guy, instead of me...
C                  G
I'd never let you down.

C           G                Bb         A
It always seems like you're going somewhere,
Dm       C                  G
better than you've been before.
C              G           Bb         A
When I go to sleep, and I dream all night,
Dm       C              G
of you knocking on my door.

C              G        Bb      A    Dm
That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
C                 G
Looking right at me.
C          G       Bb        A     Dm
If I could be that guy, instead of me...
C                 G.      G            C
I'd be all I can be. I'd be all I can be.

C            G             Bb      A
I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
Dm           C                  G
I'm nothing much, I know it's true.
C           G             Bb      A
I lack the style and the pedigree
Dm       C             G
And my chances are so few

C          G       Bb        A     Dm
That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
C                 G
Looking right at me.
C          G       Bb        A     Dm
If I could be that guy, instead of me...
C                   G
I'd give you all I got.

C         G                 Bb      A
I never tought that I could be so bold,
Dm       C                  G
to even say these toughts aloud.
C             G       Bb         A
But if let's say, it won't work out.
Dm       C                G
You know where I can be found.

C          G       Bb        A     Dm
That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
C                 G
Looking right at me.
C          G       Bb        A     Dm
If I could be that guy, instead of me...
C                 G.     G                 C
I'd never let you down. I'd never let you down.
