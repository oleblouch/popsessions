[Intro]
B
(8 bars)

[Verse 1]
B
All the old paintings on the tombs

They do the sand dance, don't you know

If they move too quick (oh whey oh)

They're falling down like a domino
B
All the bazaar men by the Nile

They got the money on a bet

Gold crocodiles (oh whey oh)

They snap their teeth on your cigarette
E
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh

[Chorus]
B
Walk like an Egyptian

[Instrumental]
B
(8 bars)

[Verse 2]
B
The blonde waitresses take their trays

They spin around and they cross the floor

They've got the moves (oh whey oh)

You drop your drink then they bring you more
B
All the school kids so sick of books

They like the punk and the metal band

When the buzzer rings (oh whey oh)

They're walking like an Egyptian
E
All the kids in the marketplace say

Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh

[Chorus]
B
Walk like an Egyptian

(Whistling)

N.C. (only drums)
Slide your feet up the street, bend your back

Shift your arm then you pull it back

Life is hard, you know (oh whey oh)

So strike a pose on a Cadillac

[Verse 3]
B
If you want to find all the cops

They're hanging out in the donut shop

They sing and dance (oh whey oh)

They spin their clubs, cruise down the block
B
All the Japanese with their yen

The party boys call the Kremlin

And the Chinese know (oh whey oh)

They walk the line like Egyptian
E
All the cops in the donut shop say

Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh

[Chorus]
B
Walk like an Egyptian

Walk like an Egyptian

[Outro]
