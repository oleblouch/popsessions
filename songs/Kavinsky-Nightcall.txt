Am  G/B  F  Dm
Am  G/B  F  Dm


[Verse 1]
           Am                   G/B            F      Dm 
I'm giving you a  night call to tell you how I feel 
          Am                    G/B             F         Dm
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills 
          Am                 G/B               F        Dm
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear 
          Am                  G/B               F        Dm
I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear 


[Chorus]
F                    G          Em
 There's something inside you
             F          F
It's hard to explain
                G                Em
They're talking about you boy
                     F       F
But you're still the same

                    G          Em
There's something inside you
             F          F
It's hard to explain
                G                Em
They're talking about you boy
                     F
But you're still the same
