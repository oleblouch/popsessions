[Intro]
F#m C#m

[Verse]
         F#m         C#m
Oh, the night is my world
      F#m           C#m
City light painted girl
        E            Bm
In the day nothing matters
          D                A
It's the night time that flatters

         F#m        C#m
In the night, no control
            F#m                  C#m
Through the wall something's breaking
          E               Bm
Wearing white as you're walkin'
           D           A
Down the street of my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control
F#m                    C#m
You got me livin' only for the night
E                              Bm
Before the morning comes, the story's told
D                              A
You take my self, you take my self control

         F#m           C#m
Another night, another day goes by
F#m                     C#m
I never stop myself to wonder why
E                        Bm
You help me to forget to play my role
D                              A
You take my self, you take my self control

[Chorus]
F#m   C#m                             F#m
I, I live among the creatures of the night
   C#m                             E
I haven't got the will to try and fight
  Bm                          D
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
        A
That tomorrow never comes

       F#m         C#m                        F#m
A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream
  C#m                                E
I know the night is not as it would seem
   Bm                                D
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
            A
That this night will never go

[Bridge]
        F#m       C#m       F#m       C#m 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
        F#m       C#m       F#m       C#m 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse]
         F#m         C#m
Oh, the night is my world
      F#m           C#m
City light painted girl
        E            Bm
In the day nothing matters
          D                A
It's the night time that flatters

[Chorus]
F#m   C#m                             F#m
I, I live among the creatures of the night
   C#m                             E
I haven't got the will to try and fight
  Bm                          D
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
        A
That tomorrow never knows

       F#m         C#m                        F#m
A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream
  C#m                                E
I know the night is not as it would seem
   Bm                                D
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
            A
That this night will never go

[Outro]
        F#m       C#m       F#m       C#m 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control
F#m                           C#m
You take my self, you take my self control [fade out]
