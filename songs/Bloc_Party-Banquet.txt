[Intro]

Am   Dm   C   F


[Verse 1]

Am   Dm       C       F
   A heart of stone a smoking gun
Am       Dm       C           F
   i can give you life, i can take it away
Am   Dm       C       F
   A heart of stone a smoking gun
Am     Dm         C   F          Am   Dm  C   F  Am   Dm  C   F

[Chorus]

Am                   C/B C
   Turning away from the light
            F  F/G
   Becoming adult
Am                 C       F  F/G
   Turning into my soul
Am                      C/B  C
   I wanted to bite not destroy
               F    F/G
   To feel her underneath
Am                 C       F  F/G
   Turning into my soul


[Verse 2]

N.C.          Am            Dm  C   F Am   Dm  C   F 
   She don't think straight
 
             Am           Dm          C          F
   She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
           Am               Dm          C          F
   And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
           Am               Dm      C              F
   And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
   Am                Dm           C        G
   Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled


[Chorus]

Am                   C/B C
   Turning away from the light
            F  F/G
   Becoming adult
Am                 C       F  F/G
   Turning into my soul
Am                      C/B  C
   I wanted to bite not destroy
               F    F/G
   To feel her underneath
Am                 C       F  F/G
   Turning into my soul


[Bridge]

F            Em  Am
   And if you feel a little left behind
F         Em             Am 
   I will see you on the other side


[Outro]

              Am    Dm   C   F
   Cos I'm on fire
          Am    Dm           C   F
   I'm on fire when you come
           Am    Dm   C   F
   Cos I'm on fire
          Am    Dm           C   F

       Am    
I'm on fire
