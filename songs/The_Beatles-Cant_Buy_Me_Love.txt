CAN'T BUY ME LOVE
(Lennon/McCartney)
A Hard Day's Night (1964)

Most of the C chords here can be played as C7, too. The 7th is there somewhere in the
Beatles' recording, but when played without a band with one guitar only, it might be 
a little too much. Some of the comments here suggest to play the 7th chords as barree
rather than their open versions. Might be a solution. It's probably a matter of taste,
whether to put it in or leave it out.
