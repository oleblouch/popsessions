[Verse 1]
G         Bm               C        G
Somewhere over the rainbow,  way up high
C       G                        D              Em  C
and the dreams that you dream of once in a lullaby. Ohhhh.

Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly

    G
Someday I'll wish upon a star,
Bm                                 Em   C
wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
      G
Where trouble melts like lemon drops,
Bm
high above the chimney tops,
       Em           C
that's where you'll find me, oh

[Verse 3]
G         Bm               C           G
Somewhere over the rainbow,  bluebirds fly
C       G                           D                 Em C
and the dreams that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I? I-I-I, oh

[Bridge]
    G
Someday I'll wish upon a star,
Bm                                 Em   C
wake up where the clouds are far behind me-e-e.
      G
Where troubles melts like lemon drops,
Bm
high above the chimney tops
       Em           C
that's where you'll find me, oh
