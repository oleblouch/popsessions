[Intro]
Am  E  Dm7  E


[Verse 1]
      Am E         Dm9  E           Dm7  E         Am
Sugar Man won't you hurry, cos I'm tired of these scenes
      Am E             Dm9 E                   Dm7     E        Am
For a blue coin won't you bring back all those colours to my dreams

[Chorus]
 C      Am      D7       F      C       Am     F          Bb  E
Silver magic ships you carry - jumpers, coke, sweet 'Mary Jane'


[Verse 2]
      Am E         Dm9 E           Dm7    E     Am
Sugar Man, met a false friend on a lonely dusty road
         Am E          Dm9  E           Dm7       E          Am
Lost my heart, when I found it it had turned to dead black coal


[Chorus]
 C      Am     D7        F       C        Am     F          Bb E
Silver magick ships you carry - jumpers, coke, sweet 'Mary Jane'


[Verse 3]
      Am E            Dm9 E                Dm7       E    Am  E
Sugar Man you're the answer that makes my questions disappear
      Am E           Dm9 E         Dm7    E      Am  E
Sugar Man, cos I'm weary of those double games I hear

Dm7 E

Sugar Man, Sugar Man, Sugar Man, Sugar Man, Sugar Man, Sugar Man, Sugar Man,  Sugar Man
