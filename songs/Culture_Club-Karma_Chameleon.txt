       Bb           F            Bb
Desert love in your eyes all the way
     Bb             F              Bb
if I listen to your lies would you say
      Eb             F
I'm a man without conviction
      Eb              F
I'm a man who doesn't know
       Eb             F
How to sell a contracdiction
             Cm
You come and go
             Gm F
You come and go

Red, gold and green


[Verse]

       Bb               F           Bb
Didn't hear your wicked words every day
        Bb            F                 Bb
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
        Eb            F
That my love was an addiction
        Eb                F
When we cling our love is strong
         Eb               F
When you go you're gone forever
            Cm
You string along
            Gm F
You string along

You're my lover, not my rival
Eb                     Dm
