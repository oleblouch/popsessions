[Verse]
          A             Bm7
There's a place in your heart
      C#m             Bm7/E
And I know that it is love
         A
And this place could be much
Bm7             C#m     Bm7/E
Brighter than tomorrow
       A          Bm7
And if you really try
            C#m                Bm7/E
You'll find there's no need to cry
        A
In this place you'll feel
Bm7                C#m    Bm7/E
There's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
         Bm7      C#m
There are ways to get there
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7
Make a little space
D/E                E
Make a better place

[Chorus]
         A
Heal the world
          Bm7
Make it a better place
    Bm7/E       E
For you and for me
        A
And the entire human race
E/G#      F#m    C#m
There are people dying
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7              D/E         A
Make a better place for you and for me

[Instrumental]
Bm7     C#m    Bm7/E

[Verse]
       A            Bm7
If you want to know why
          C#m              Bm7/E
There's a love that cannot lie
        A              Bm7             C#m     Bm7/E
Love is strong it only cares for joyful giving
      A            Bm7
If we try we shall see
        C#m             Bm7/E
In this bliss we cannot feel
        A             Bm7
Fear or dread we stop existing
          C#m     Bm7/E
And start living

[Pre-Chorus]
      Bm7          C#m
Then it feels that always
D                    C#m
Love's enough for us growing
          Bm7
So make a better world
D/E           E
Make a better world

[Chorus]
         A
Heal the world
          Bm7
Make it a better place
    Bm7/E       E
For you and for me
        A
And the entire human race
E/G#      F#m    C#m
There are people dying
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7              D/E         A
Make a better place for you and for me

[Bridge]
        G
And the dream we were conceived in
              A
Will reveal a joyful face
        G
And the world we once believed in
           A
Will shine again in grace
     F#m            C#m
Then why do we keep strangling life
           D                  C#m
Wound this earth crucify this soul
            Bm7
Though it's plain to see

This world is heavenly
   D/E      E
Be God's glow

[Verse]
         A      Bm7
We could fly so high
        C#m           Bm7/E
Let our spirits never die
      A            Bm7           C#m      Bm7/E
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
         A             Bm7
Create a world with no fear
            C#m       Bm7/E
Together we'll cry happy tears
        A                  Bm7
See the nations turn their swords
     C#m        Bm7/E
Into plowshares

[Pre-Chorus]
      Bm7       C#m
We could really get there
       D                    C#m
If you cared enough for the living
       Bm7
Make a little space
D/E        E
To make a better place

[Chorus]
         A
Heal the world
          Bm7
Make it a better place
    Bm7/E       E
For you and for me
        A
And the entire human race
E/G#      F#m    C#m
There are people dying
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7              D/E         A
Make a better place for you and for me
