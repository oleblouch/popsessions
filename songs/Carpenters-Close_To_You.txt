Close To You - The Carpenters:
#1 in 1970.

[Verse 1]
       Ab               G7sus 
Why do birds suddenly appear,
G7    Gm7          Cm7
every time you are near?
Ab      
Just like me, they long to be
Eb6
close to you.

[Verse 2]
       Ab                       G7sus
Why do stars fall down from the sky,
G7    Gm7           Cm7
every time you walk by?
Ab                             Eb6      EbM7 EbM6 EbM7
Just like me, they long to be, close to you.

[Chorus]
Ab
On the day that you were born,
                            Gm
the angels got together and decided to 
                    C9
create a dream come true.
C7       Ab
So, they sprinkled moon dust 
                AbM7
in your hair of gold and starlight
Ab6             Bb
in your eyes of blue.

[Verse 3]
Bb      Ab                  G7
That is why all the boys in town,
       Gm7      Cm7
follow you all around.
Ab                             Eb6      EbM7 Eb6 EbM7
Just like me, they long to be, close to you. 

[Chorus]
Ab
On the day that you were born,
                            Gm
the angels got together and decided to 
                    C9
create a dream come true.
C7       Ab
So, they sprinkled moon dust 
                AbM7
in your hair of gold and starlight
Ab6             Bb
in your eyes of blue.

[Verse 4]
Bb      Ab                  G7
That is why all the boys in town,
       Gm7      Cm7
follow you all around.
Ab                             Eb6      EbM7 Eb6 EbM7
Just like me, they long to be, close to you.
