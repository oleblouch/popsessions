     A5            E5
This time we will end it

      F5                       A5
This life ain't got no future, girl



      A5               E5
Don't say it's not my business

     F5                       A5
It's tragic you don't feel my pity




     A5               E5
Just think of all the others

          F5                  A5         
What they think they feel the same


         A5              E5
But the letters are not golden

          F5                            A5
Till they write them on your tombstone, girl




Refrain
=======

Am                        E
Shoot, baby! Shoot! Baby, pull the trigger!

       C                      D
Fire a bullet , an arrow or a poisoned dart, baby!

F                           Am
Shoot, baby! Shoot! Free us from the pressure!

       H
With a rifle or a gun!

         E
We can't live forever!



         A5       E5
It takes just one second

      F5                    A5
I'm trying not to cause you pain



     A5                   E5
They say that this forest's haunted

      F5                         A5
You soon will find new friends in ghosts


      A5               E5
Just hope that I will aim right

     F5          A5
But if it's over soon!


Refrain (until end)
=======

Am                        E
Shoot, baby! Shoot! Baby, pull the trigger!

       C                      D
Fire a bullet , an arrow or a poisoned dart, baby!

F                           Am
Shoot, baby! Shoot! Free us from the pressure!

       H
With a rifle or a gun!

         E
We can't live forever!
