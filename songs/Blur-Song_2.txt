[Intro]

G5    F5    Bb5    D5    x6


[Verse]

        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
I got my head checked
        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
By a jumbo jet
        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
It wasn't easy
        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
But nothing is,          no


[Chorus]

        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
When I feel heavy metal
         G5      F5     Bb5  D5
And I'm pins and I'm needles
        G5      F5     Bb5  D5
Well I lie and I'm easy
   F5                   G5                    Bb5
All of the time but I'm never sure when I need you
Bb5
Pleased to meet you


[Verse]

        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
I got my head done
        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
When I was young
        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
It's not my problem
        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
It's not my problem


[Chorus]

        G5      F5    Bb5  D5
When I feel heavy metal
         G5      F5     Bb5  D5
And I'm pins and I'm needles
        G5       F5    Bb5  D5
Well I lie and I'm easy
   F5                   G5                    Bb5
All of the time but I'm never sure when I need you
Bb5
Pleased to meet you
