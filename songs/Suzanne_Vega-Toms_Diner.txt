[Verse]

Em
I am sitting in the morning
A
At the diner on the corner
Em
I am waiting at the counter
A
For the man to pour the coffee

G6
And he fills it only halfway
C
And before I even argue
Am
He is looking out the window
F                  Em
At somebody coming in

Em
"It is always nice to see you"
A
Says the man behind the counter
Em
To the woman who has come in
A
She is shaking her umbrella

G6
And I look the other way
C
As they are kissing their hellos
Am
And I'm pretending not to see them
F                   Em
Instead, I pour the milk

Em
I open up the paper
A
There's a story of an actor
Em
Who had died while he was drinking
A
It was no one I had heard of

G6
And I'm turning to the horoscope
C
And looking for the funnies
Am
When I'm feeling someone watching me
F                 Em
And so I raise my head

Em
There's a woman on the outside
A
Looking inside, does she see me?
Em
No, she does not really see me
A
Cause she sees her own reflection

G6
And I'm trying not to notice
C
That she's hitching up her skirt
Am
And while she's straightening her stockings
F                   Em
Her hair has gotten wet

Em
Oh, this rain it will continue
A
Through the morning as I'm listening
Em                  C    G6
To the bells of the cathedral
Em A C        F       Am
I am thinking of your voice

Em         C        F      A            Em
And of the midnight picnic once upon a time
C          F    C
Before the rain began...
Em
And I finish up my coffee
A
And it's time to catch the train
