CAPO ON 5TH 

[Verse 1]
Am
   So sentimental
Em                  
   Not sentimental, no!
C                        Em
Romantic, not discussing yet

Darling I'm
C                             Am
Down and lonely when with the fortunate only
                      Dsus4
I've been looking for something else
                        Em
Do let, do let, do let, Jugulate, do let, do

   Am
Let's go slowly, discouraged
Em
Distant from other interests
C                         Em
On your favorite weekend Ending
                C
This love's for gentlemen only
                Am
That's with the fortunate only
                Dsus4
No I gotta be someone else
                          Em                                C
These days it comes it comes it comes it comes it comes and goes


[Chorus]
            Am
A Lisztomania
                      D
Think less but see it grow
                          C
Like a riot, like a riot, Oh!
            Am
Not easily offended
                   D                            C
Know how to let it go from a mess to the masses

            Am
A Lisztomania
                      D
Think less but see it grow
                          C
Like a riot, like a riot, Oh!
            Am
Not easily offended
                   D                        
Know how to let it go from a mess to the masses

We'll burn the pictures instead
C                         Em
When it's all over we can barely discuss
    C
For one minute only
             Am
Not with the fortunate only
                                     Dsus4
Thought it could have been something else
                          Em                                C
These days it comes it comes it comes it comes it comes and goes
