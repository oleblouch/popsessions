[Verse 1]
G
When I'm with you baby, I go out of my head,
      C
and I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough.

G 
All the things you do to me, and everything you said,
      C
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough.

D                                Em
We slip and slide as we fall in love,
       C                 D
And I just can't seem to get enough of

[Verse 2]
G
We walk together, walking down the street,
      C
and I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough.
G
Every time I think of you, I know we have to meet,
      C                            
and I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough.

D                                     Em
It's getting harder, it's a burning love,
C                        D
And I just can't seem to get enough of

A D A D A D A D7

[Chorus]
   G                     
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,
   G
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,

[Verse 3]
G
And when it rains, you're shining down for me,
       C
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,
G
Just like a rainbow, you know you set me free,
       C
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,

D                             Em
You're like an angel and you give me your love,
C
And I just can't seem to get enough of
