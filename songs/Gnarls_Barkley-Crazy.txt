Cm                                                     Eb
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                           Ab
There was something so pleasant about that phase.

Even your emotions had an echo
           Gsus4  G
In so much space
Cm
And when you're out there, without care,
                   Eb
Yeah, I was out of touch
                                    Ab
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
                Gsus4  G
I just knew too much

[Chorus]
                  Cm
Does that make me cra-zy
                  Eb
Does that make me cra-zy
                  Ab
Does that make me cra-zy
     Gsus4  G
Possibly

C                                              Ab
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
          Eb                    Gsus4  G
But think twice, that's my only advice
Cm                                                                    Eb
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
                      Ab
Ha ha ha bless your soul
                           Gsus4  G
You really think you're in control

[Chorus]
              Cm
Well, I think you're crazy
               Eb
I think you're crazy
               Ab
I think you're crazy
          Gsus4  G
Just like me

[Verse]
C                                                      Ab
  My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
             Eb                                   Gsus4  G
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Cm                                                              Eb
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
                                Ab
And it's no coincidence I've come
                          Gsus4  G
And I can die when I'm done

[Chorus]
      Cm
Maybe I'm crazy
             Eb
Maybe you're crazy
            Ab
Maybe we're crazy
       Gsus4  G
Probably
