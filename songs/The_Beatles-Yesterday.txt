[Verse 1]
F         Em7     A7                 Dm     Dm/C
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Bb       C7                     F            F/E Dm  G7       Bb F F
 Now it looks as though they're here to stay, oh I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
F        Em7      A7             Dm         Dm/C
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
Bb         C7             F        F/E Dm   G7       Bb F F
 There's a shadow hanging over me, oh yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Em7 A7   Dm  Dm/C Bb         Gm        C        F
Why she  had to   go I don't know, she wouldn't say
Em7 A7   Dm  Dm/C  Bb           Gm       C     F
I   said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
F         Em7       A7           Dm          Dm/C
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Bb     C7              F          F/E Dm  G7       Bb F F
 Now I need a place to hide away, oh  I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Em7 A7   Dm  Dm/C Bb           Gm       C       F
 Why she  had to   go I don't know, she wouldn't say
Em7 A7   Dm  Dm/C  Bb           Gm       C     F
I   said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

[Verse]
F        Em7        A7           Dm           Dm/C
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Bb     C7              F          F/E Dm  G7       Bb F F
 Now I need a place to hide away, oh  I believe in yesterday
