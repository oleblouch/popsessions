Artist: Jeff Buckley 
Song: Lilac Wine 
(Track 04 - 'Grace' album)
This is virtually the same as most other Lilac Wine tabs I've seen on the net, except I
it to make it easier to play so you can focus more on the incredible vocals!  I made it
by just putting a capo on the 3rd fret, which makes all the chords easier to play.  
you're going to miss some of the little complexities that Jeff Buckley adds to the
but this is an OK version I hope will be of use to people!
Please don't flame me, I know it's not the perfect version, that's the point!

Capo - 3rd fret

[Verse]
Em
I lost myself on a cool damp night
C
Gave myself in that misty light
B7                  Am
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
B7            Em
Under a lilac tree
Em
I made wine from the lilac tree
C
Put my heart in its recipe
Am
It makes me see what I want to see...
B7                    Em
And be what I want to be
Ddim                     A
When I think more than I want to think
Am                       Em
Do things I never should do
Ddim                     A
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Am                             Em       B7
Because it brings me back you...

[Instrumental]
E      E7

[Chorus]
E       E7      A         B7    E         E7
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
A     Bm E  A         Bm  E  A
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
C                            B7
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
B7                          F#m7     B7
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?

[Chorus]
E     E7   A         B7         E        E7
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
A     Bm E  A         Bm  E  A
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love
C                                  B7
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
B7                                F#m7   B7
Isnt that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

[Outro]
E     E7     A       B7     E      E7
Lilac wine, I feel unready, for my love
           A    Am    B7       E
I feel unready       for my love...
