G                            Am 
STRANGE fits of passion have I known:
C                   G
And I will dare to tell,
G                      Am 
But in the lover's ear alone,
C                   G 
What once to me befell.

G                             Am 
When she I loved look'd every day
C                    G 
Fresh as a rose in June,
G                        Am 
I to her cottage bent my way,
C                    G
Beneath an evening moon.

[CHORUS]

Em          Em/Eb
Upon the moon I fix'd my eye,
	Em7/C	        A
All over the wide lea;
	C				G
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
	Am		D	D7
Those paths so dear to me.

G                             Am 
And now we reach'd the orchard-plot;
C                    G 
And, as we climb'd the hill,
G                          Am 
The sinking moon to Lucy's cot
C                    G 
Came near and nearer still.
G                             Am 
In one of those sweet dreams I slept,
C                    G 
Kind Nature's gentlest boon!
G                             Am 
And all the while my eyes I kept
C                    G 
On the descending moon.

[CHORUS]

Em          Em/C#
Upon the moon I fix'd my eye,
	Em7/C	        A
All over the wide lea;
	C				G
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
	Am		D	D7
Those paths so dear to me.

G                             Am 
My horse moved on; hoof after hoof
C                    G 
He raised, and never stopp'd:
G                             Am 
When down behind the cottage roof,
C                    G 
At once, the bright moon dropp'd.
 
G                             Am 
What fond and wayward thoughts will slide
C                    G 
Into a lover's head!
G                         Am 
'O mercy!' to myself I cried,
C                    G 
'If Lucy should be dead!'
