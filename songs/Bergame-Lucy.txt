couplet G	Am	C	G
refrain Em - Em/Eb - Em7 - A
 C G Am D D7

G 								Am 
STRANGE fits of passion have I known:
C 					G
And I will dare to tell,
G 						Am 
But in the lover's ear alone,
C 					G 
What once to me befell.

G 							Am 
When she I loved look'd every day
C 					G 
Fresh as a rose in June,
G 						Am 
I to her cottage bent my way,
C 					G
Beneath an evening moon.

[CHORUS]

Em          EmMaj7/Eb
Upon the moon I fix'd my eye,
	Em7/C	        A
All over the wide lea;
	C				G
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
	Am		D	D7
Those paths so dear to me.
 
And now we reach'd the orchard-plot;
And, as we climb'd the hill,
The sinking moon to Lucy's cot
Came near and nearer still.
 
In one of those sweet dreams I slept,
Kind Nature's gentlest boon!
And all the while my eyes I kept
On the descending moon.

[CHORUS]

Dm          Dm/C#
Upon the moon I fix'd my eye,
	Dm7/C	        G
All over the wide lea;
	Bb				F
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
	Gm		C	C7
Those paths so dear to me.

My horse moved on; hoof after hoof
He raised, and never stopp'd:
When down behind the cottage roof,
At once, the bright moon dropp'd.
 
What fond and wayward thoughts will slide
Into a lover's head!
'O mercy!' to myself I cried,
'If Lucy should be dead!'
