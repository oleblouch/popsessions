[Verse 1]
G            C
When I'm out walking
  G         C
I strut my stuff
G       C         G
And I'm so strung out
  G         C
I'm high as a kite
G      C     G       C         G
I just might stop to check you out

[Chorus]
          Em
Let me go on like a
C
Blister in the sun
          Em
Let me go on
    C                        D
Big hands, I know you're the one

[Verse 2]
G        C
Body and beats,
  G         C
I stain my sheets
G       C         G
I don't even know why
G      C
My girlfriend,
G            C    G      C           G  
She's at the end, She is starting to cry

[Chorus]
          Em
Let me go on like a
C
Blister in the sun
          Em
Let me go on
    C                         D
Big hands, I know you're the one

D

G      C     G       C         G
I just might stop to check you out
