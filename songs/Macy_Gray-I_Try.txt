[Intro]
| E Fdim | Fdim Csus4 | D -

[Verse 1]
D                   A
Games changes and fears
               Em
When will they go from here? When will they stop?
                D                   A
I believe that fate has brought us here
                   Em7
And we should be together babe, but we're not
G                       F#m7
I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
Em7                             A
And I'll keep my cool but I'm feigning

[Chorus]
                D
I try to say goodbye and I choke
              Asus
I try to walk away and I stumble
                 Em7
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
            G                       A
My world crumbles when you are not near
   D
Goodbye and I choke
            Asus
Try to walk away and I stumble
                 Em7
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
            G
My world crumbles when you are not near

[Verse 2]
D                   A
I may appear to be free
                  Em
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
                  D                         A
And I may seem alright and smile when you leave
                   Em7
But my smiles are just a front, just a front
G                      F#m7
I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
Em7                             A
And I'll keep my cool but I'm feigning

[Chorus]
                D
I try to say goodbye and I choke
              Asus
I try to walk away and I stumble
                 Em7
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
            G                       A
My world crumbles when you are not near
   D
Goodbye and I choke 
            Asus
Try to walk away and I stumble
                 Em7
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
            G
My world crumbles when you are not near

[Bridge]
Fmaj7           Am7                      Fmaj7
Here is my confession, May I be your possession
                 Em7                         C7
Boy I need your touch, your love kisses and such
                    Bm7                   Em
With all my might I try but this I can't deny, deny
G                       F#m7
I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
Em                              A
And I'll keep my cool but I'm feigning

(Key change)

[Outro]
   Bb          Eb
I try to say goodbye and I choke
           Bbsus
Try to walk away and I stumble
                 Fm7
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
            Ab                  Bb
My world crumbles when you are not near
    Eb
Goodbye and I choke
               Bb
I try to walk away and I stumble
                Fm7
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
         Ab
My world crumbles when you are not near
    Eb
Goodbye and I choke
               Bb
I try to walk away and I stumble
                 Fm7
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
            Ab                  Bb
My world crumbles when you are not near
Eb                Bb Fm7 Ab Bb  Eb
Yeah yeah yeah...
