[Verse]
        Em             
Imagine me and you, I do
                  D
I think about you day and night, it’s only right
                   C
To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight
           B
So happy together
            Em
If I should call you up, invest a dime
                  D
And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind
                C               
Imagine how the world would be, so very fine
           B
So happy together

[Chorus]
E              Bm7               E               G
I can't see me lovin’ nobody but you, for all my life
E                   Bm7                     E               G
When you’re with me baby, the skies will be blue for all my life

[Verse]
Em                        
Me and you, and you and me
                   D             
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
                 C            
The only one for me is you, and you for me
           B
So happy together.

E                   Bm7                     E               G
When you’re with me baby, the skies will be blue for all my life

No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
                 C            
The only one for me is you, and you for me
           B
So happy together.

No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
