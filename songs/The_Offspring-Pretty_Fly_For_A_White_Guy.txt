[Verse 1]

    Bm                F#
You know it's kind of hard
A       Bm          Em D
Just to get along today
    Bm            F#
Our subject isn't cool
A      Bm          Em D
But he fakes it anyway
   Bm             F#
He may not have a clue 
A      Bm            Em  D
And he may not have style
    Bm            F#
But everything he lacks
A       Bm              Em D
Well he makes up in denial so-


[Chorus]

 Bm      F   F# F
-Don't debate 
F# Bm      F      F# F#
a  player straight
D           A
You know he really
D       Em        D
doesn't get it anyway
     A     Bm
He's gonna play the
F    F# F F#  Bm
field     and keep it
F   F# F F#  D
real     For you no
A  D    Em
way for you no way
      Bm        F
So if you don't rate
F#   F F# Bm    F
just o-vercompensate
F# F     F#   D           A      
At least that you'll know you
    D      Em          D
can always go on Ricki Lake
G                 A     
  The world needs wannabes
  Bm
a hey hey So do that
          Bm (hold)
brand new thing

[Verse 2]

   Bm              F#
He needs some cool tunes
A        Bm          Em
Not just any will suffice
D        Bm              F#
But they didn't have Ice Cube
A     Bm             Em D
So he bought Vanilla Ice
    Bm              F#
Now cruising in his Pinto
A      Bm           Em  D
he sees homies as he pass
    Bm          F#
But if he looks twice They're
A     Bm       Em       D
gonna kick his lily ass so-

[Verse 3]

         Bm
Now he's getting a tattoo
     A    Bm
yeah He's getting ink done
A  Bm
He asked for a 13
    A    Bm      Em
but they drew a 31
        D        Bm
Friends say he's trying
             A    Bm
too hard And he's not quite
    A   Bm
hip But in his own mind
     A   Bm
He's the dopest trip
