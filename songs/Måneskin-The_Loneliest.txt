[Chorus]
C
 You'll be the saddest part of me
Em
  A part of me that will never be
Am
Mine, it's obvious
G
 Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
C
 You're still the oxygen I breathe
Em                               Am
  I see your face when I close my eyes

It's torturous
G
 Tonight is gonna be the loneliest


[Verse 1]
C
 There's a few lines that I have wrote
Em                                Am
  In case of death, that's what I want
                  G
That's what I want
C
 So don't be sad when I'll be gone
Em                                   Am
  There's just one thing, I hope you know
            G
I loved you so


[Pre-Chorus]
       C
'Cause I don't even care about the time, I've got left here
    Em
The only thing I know now is that I want to spend it
     Dm
With you, with you

Nobody else here
G
 Tonight is gonna be the loneliest


[Chorus]
C
 You'll be the saddest part of me
E
  A part of me that will never be
Am
Mine, it's obvious
F
 Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
C
 You're still the oxygen I breathe
E                               Am
  I see your face when I close my eyes

It's torturous
G
 Tonight is gonna be the loneliest


[Verse 2]
C
 I'm sorry but I gotta go
Em                                  Am
  If you'll ever miss me, give this song
        G
Another go


[Pre-Chorus]
    C
And I just keep on thinking how you made me feel better
    Em
And all the crazy little things that we did together
Dm
In the end, in the end

It doesn't matter
  G
If tonight is gonna be the loneliest


[Chorus]
C
 You'll be the saddest part of me
E
  A part of me that will never be
Am
Mine, it's obvious
F
 Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
C
 You're still the oxygen I breathe
E                               Am
  I see your face when I close my eyes

It's torturous
G
 Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
