[Verse 1]
              E      Bm7  Dsus2 A         E  Bm7  Dsus2  A
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony that's life
          E           Bm7            Dsus2       A             E     Bm7  Dsus2  A
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die
              E        Bm7   Dsus2    A    E         Bm7  Dsus2  A
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
             E        Bm7              Dsus2          A            E        Bm7  Dsus2  A
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah

[Chorus]
E                 Bm7           Dsus2        A
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
         E          Bm7         Dsus2         A
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould
          E                 Bm7          Dsus2         A
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
            E            Bm7     Dsus2   A                 E          Bm7  Dsus2  A
I can't change my mould, no  no  no  no  no  no
                                           (have you ever been down?)

E  Bm7  Dsus2  A

[Verse 2]
            E     Bm7        Dsus2       A     E          Bm7  Dsus2  A
Well, I've never prayed but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
          E         Bm7         Dsus2         A       E        Bm7  Dsus2  A
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
          E        Bm7         Dsus2      A            E        Bm7  Dsus2   A
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
         E           Bm7               Dsus2   A         E      Bm7   Dsus2  A
but the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

[Chorus]
E                Bm7           Dsus2         A
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
         E          Bm7        Dsus2            A
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould
          E                 Bm7         Dsus2          A
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
           E             Bm7     Dsus2   A                     E
I can't change my mould, no  no  no  no  no  no
                                           (and have you ever been down?)
        Bm7           Dsus2         A             E  Bm7  Dsus2  A
I can't change it you know, I can't change it...

[Verse 3]
              E      Bm7  Dsus2 A         E   Bm7  Dsus2  A
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony that's life
          E          Bm7            Dsus2      A             E     Bm7  Dsus2  A
Trying to make ends meet, trying to find some money then you die
              E        Bm7  Dsus2     A    E         Bm7  Dsus2  A
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
             E        Bm7              Dsus2          A           E          Bm7  Dsus2  A
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah

[Chorus]
           E                 Bm7              Dsus2      A
You know I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
         E          Bm7         Dsus2         A
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould
          E                 Bm7          Dsus2         A
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
            E            Bm7     Dsus2   A
I can't change my mould, no  no  no  no  no
           E             Bm7     Dsus2   A
I can't change my mould, no  no  no  no  no
        E           Bm7        Dsus2   A
I can't   change my mould, no  no  no  no

[Outro]
           E         Bm7       Dsus2      A
(It's just   sex and violence, melody and silence)...
               E        Bm7  Dsus2     A    E          Bm7  Dsus2   A
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)...
...
(Been down)
(Ever been down)
