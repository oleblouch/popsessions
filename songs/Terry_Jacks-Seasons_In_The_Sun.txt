[Verse 1]

G                  D      G
Goodbye to you my trusted friend
                                      Am
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
                                 G
Together we've climbed hills and trees
                      Am
Learned of love and ABC's
            D                     G
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
G                      D       G
Goodbye my friend it's hard to die
                               Am
When all the birds are singing in the sky
                         G
Now that spring is in the air
                      Am
Pretty girls are everywhere
D                      G
Think of me and I'll be there


[Chorus]

D      G                     Am
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
        D                                             G
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time


[Verse 2]

G                    D         G
Goodbye papa, please pray for me
                               Am
I was the black sheep of the family
                                   G
You've tried to teach me right from wrong
                           Am
Too much wine and too much song
D                 G
Wonder how I got along

G                 D        G
Goodbye papa it's hard to die
                               Am
When all the birds are singing in the sky
                         G
Now that spring is in the air
                    Am
Little children everywhere
D                         G
When you see them I'll be there


[Chorus]

D      G                     Am
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
        D                                           G
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone
D      G                     Am
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
        D                                           G
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone


[Verse 3]

G                    D      G
Goodbye Michelle my little one
                               Am
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
                         G
And every time that I was down
                      Am
You would always come around
D                           G
And get my feet back on the ground
G                      D       G
Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die
                               Am
When all the birds are singing in the sky
                         G
Now that spring is in the air
                      Am
With the flowers everywhere
D                            G
I wish that we could both be there
