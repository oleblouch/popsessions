[Intro]

D    A    Bm    Bb  A  x2


[Verse 1]
D        A              Bm                  Bb
He was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious?
D        A             Bm           C
He was a punk, she did ballet, what more can I say?
D         A                Bm                 Bb
He wanted her, she'd never tell that secretly she wanted him as well
D              A                      Bm               C
But all of her friends stuck up their nose, they had a problem with his
F
baggy clothes


[Chorus]
         C                            Bb
He was a skater boy, she said see you later boy,
          A               F
he wasn't good enough for her
          C                             Bb
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space,
              A                 Bb
she needed to come back down to earth


[Verse 2]
D               A                Bm
Five years from now, she sits at home,
            Bb
feeding the baby, she's all alone
D             A                Bm
She turns on TV, guess who she sees
           C
Skater boy rocking up MTV
D                A                     Bm
She calls up her friends, they already know
                    Bb
and they've all got tickets to see his show
D          A                   Bm
She tags along, stands in the crowd,
                         C
looks up at the man that she turned down


[Chorus]
F        C                            Bb
He was a skater boy, she said see you later boy,
          A               F
he wasn't good enough for her
           C                      Bb
Now he's a super star slamming on his guitar
                 A                  F
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

        C                             Bb
He was a skater boy, she said see you later boy,
          A               F
he wasn't good enough for her
           C                      Bb
Now he's a super star slamming on his guitar
                 A                   Bb
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

[Bridge]
Dm                          F
 Sorry girl, but you missed out,
                                 C
Well, tough luck that boy's mine now
                           Bb
We are more than just good friends
        A             Dm
This is how the story ends
                          F
Too bad that you couldn't see,
                           C
See the man that boy could be
                             Bb
There is more than meets the eye
          A                D
I see the soul that is inside


[Verse 3]
            A                  Bm
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
              Bb
Can I make it any more obvious?
D          A                 Bm           C
 We are in love, haven't you heard how we rock each other's world?


[Chorus]
F            C                          Bb
I'm with the skater boy, I said see you later boy
            A                F
I'll be backstage after the show
               C                   Bb
I'll be at the studio, singing the song we wrote
        A
About a girl you used to know

F            C                          Bb
I'm with the skater boy, I said see you later boy
            A                 F
I'll be back stage after the show
               C                   Bb
I'll be at the studio, singing the song we wrote
        A                Bb
About a girl you used to know
