  Been working so hard, I'm punching my card, eight hours, for what?
                       D                                                     A

Tonight I gotta cut

    You're playing so cool, obeying every rule, but deep way down in your heart
                               D
You're burning, yearning for some, somebody to tell you
                             A
that life ain't passing you by
D                       D#dim                       E  F#7sus4  G6
  I'm trying to tell you, it will if you don't even try
        E/G# N.C.
You can fly if you'd only cut


[Chorus]

A      D   A
Loose, footloose

Kick off your Sunday shoes

Oowee, Marie
D                      A
Shake it, shake it for me
    D A
Oh, Milo
D                  A
C'mon c'mon, let's go
     D    A
Lose your blues
G         D       A
Everybody cut footloose

N.C.
Cut footloose, cut footloose, cut footloose

First - we've got to turn it around
Second - and put your feet on the ground
Third - Now take a hold of your soul

E                        N.C.           A  N.C.
Ahh.... ahh.... Ahhh.... I'm turning it loose
