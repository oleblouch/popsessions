Nina Simone
My baby just cares for me


[Verse 1]

      A            D         E
      My baby don't care for shows
      My baby don't care for clothes
      A                     Bm Bm7
      My baby just cares for me
       C#           C#7        F#m
      My baby don't care for cars and races
          B         B7      E
      My baby don't care     for high-tone places


[Verse 2]

        A            D         E
      Liz Taylor is not his style
      And even Lana Turner's smile
        A                   Bm  Bm7
      Is somethin' he can't see
       D            G#  C#m    F#
      My baby don't care who knows it
      B            E          A  E
      My baby just cares for me


[Verse 3]

       A            D         E
      My baby don't care for shows
      My baby don't care for clothes
      A                      Bm Bm7
      My baby just cares for me
       C#            C#7        F#m
      My baby don't care for cars and races
          B          B7   E
      My baby don't care   for high-tone places


[Verse 4]

       A            D         E
      Liz Taylor is not his style
      And even Lana Turner's smile
        A                   Bm  Bm7
      Is somethin' he can't see
         D            G#  C#m   F#
      I wonder what's wrong with baby
       Bm                E
      My baby just cares for
        C#m              F#
      My baby just cares for
        Bm          E        A
      My baby just cares for me
