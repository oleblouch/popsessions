[Verse]
G        C            D        G
How many roads must a man walk down,
           C          G
before you call him a man
G        C           D          G
How many seas must a white dove sail,
           C             D
before she sleeps in the sand
         G        C              D           G
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly,
               C       G
before they're forever banned

[Chorus]
C            D        G                C   
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
              D              G
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse]
         G        C           D         G
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist,
             C             G
before it is washed to the sea
         G        C              D      G
Yes, and how many years can some people exist,
               C             D
before they're allowed to be free
         G        C           D            G
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head,
                     C           G
and pretend that he just doesn't see

[Chorus]
C            D        G                C
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
              D              G
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse]
         G        C            D        G
Yes, and how many times must a man look up,
              C       G
before he can see the sky
         G        C         D       G
Yes, and how many ears must one man have,
              C           D
before he can hear people cry
         G        C              D            G
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows,
              C           G
that too many people have died

[Chorus]
C            D          G              C
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
              D              G
The answer is blowin' in the wind
