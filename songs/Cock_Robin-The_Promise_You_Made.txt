     Am
If I laid down my love
        C               F  C
To come to your defense
          Am
Would you worry for me
       C                   F  C (Am)
With a pain in your chest?

G                    F              Am   G
Could I rely on your faith to be strong
   G                      F         Am   G
To pick me back up and to push me along?

[Chorus]
G
Tell me
F         G           Em      F
You'll be there in my hour of need
F         G         Em (Am)
You won't turn me away
F       G          Em     F
Help me out of the life I lead
C                        Caug
Remember the promise you made
C                        E
Remember the promise you made

     Am
If I gave you my soul
      C                  F  C
For a peace of your mind
          Am
Would you carry me with you
       C                 F  C
To the far edge of time?
      G                     F                Am  G
Could you understand if you found me untrue?
      G                  F             Am  G
Would we become one or divided in two?

[Chorus]
G
Please tell me
F         G           Em      F
You'll be there in my hour of need
F         G        Em (Am)
You won't turn me away
F       G          Em     F
Help me out of the life I lead
C                        Caug
Remember the promise you made
C                        E
Remember the promise you made
