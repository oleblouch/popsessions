[Verse]
   G/B C    G/B         Am7
An old man turned ninety-eight
          G/B   C       G/B          Am7
He won the lottery  and died the next day
       G/B    C       G/B        Am7
It's a black fly in your chardonnay
       G/B        C           G/B          Am7
it's a death row pardon two minutes too late
              G/B    C              G/B   Am7
and isn't it Ironic?    Don't you think?

[Chorus]
              G   C*           G/B    Am7
It's like rain_____   on your wedding day
                G   C*              G/B     Am7
It's a free ride______  when you've already paid
                    G  C*           G/B        Am7
It's the good advice_____  that you just didn't take
     Bb            F              G
And who would've thought it figures

[Verse]
     G/B    C        G/B           Am7
Mr. Play-it-Safe was afraid to fly
             G/B   C                  G/B          Am7
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
              G/B        C       G/B        Am7
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
           G/B           C                G/B                Am7
and as the plane crashed down he thought "well isn't this nice"
              G/B    C              G/B   Am7
and isn't it Ironic?    Don't you think?

                    G  C*           G/B        Am7
It's the good advice_____  that you just didn't take
     Bb            F              G

[Interlude]
      F                                     G
Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you when you think everything's
     F                            G
okay and everything's going right
    F                                   G
And life has a funny way of helping you out when you think everythings gone

wrong and everything blows up in your face

    G/B    C           G/B         Am7
A traffic jam when you're already late
       G/B    C           G/B         Am7
a no-smoking-sign on your zigarette break
           G/B         C                   G/B         Am7
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
            G/B            C                          G/B         Am7
It's meeting the men of my dreams an then meeting his beautiful wife
              G/B    C              G/B   Am7
and isn't it ironic?  Don't you think?
                G/B   C                  G/B   Am7
a little too ironic     And yeah i really do think
