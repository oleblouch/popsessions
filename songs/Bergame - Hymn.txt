AT morn—at noon—at twilight dim—
D4				C
Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
G			D
In joy and wo—in good and ill—
C
Mother of God, be with me still!

When the Hours flew brightly by
And not a cloud obscured the sky,
My soul, lest it should truant be,
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;

[BRIDGE]

Now, when storms of Fate o’ercast
Darkly my Present and my Past,
Let my Future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine!
