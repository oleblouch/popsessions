F#m 
Do you read me?
F#m 
Do you read me loud?
A
Do you hear me coming
C#
To you baby?

F#m 
I'm a chopped off head 
F#m 
Cruising at the speed of sound
A
Spitfiring in the air
C#
Transmitting to the ground
 
F#m 
See I'm a projectile baby
F#m 
A radio controlled
A
And when I call out your name 
C#
It releases me from pain 

F#m 
She’s a blood-hot comet
F#m 
Going to see my rendez-vous 
A
Do you hear me coming 
C#
To you baby?

(Refrain / Chorus)
F#m                  Dm    
I was waiting for you for so many nights
F#m                  Dm     
I was waiting for you from time to time 
        Am
Do you read me? 
         C#
Do you hear me?   


F#m 
She’s headless body
F#m
Starving for your electro shocks
A
I want to shake and ride 
C#
And twist all night long

F#m
So I'm just lying on the floor
F#m
Eating some coke and silicon 
A
And hope only for the day
C#
We'll be back at one 

F#m 
She’s a headless fury
F#m
Going to meet my rendez-vous
A
Do you hear me coming 
C#
To you now baby


F#m                  Dm    
I was waiting for you for so many nights
F#m                  Dm     
I was waiting for you from time to time 
        Am
Do you read me? 
         C#
Do you hear me?
