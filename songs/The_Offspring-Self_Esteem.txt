lalalalalalalalalala..

A5   F5   C5   G5
A5   F5   C5   G5
F5   F5   F5   G5 C5 G5 C5 G5     

[Verse 1]
A5   F5   C5   G5
A5   F5   C5   G5

A5             F5       C5              G5
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
A5               F5   C5                G5
And practiced all the things I would say
A5             F5  C5             G5
But she came over, I lost my nerve
A5            F5    C5              G5
I took her back and made her dessert
A5      F5 C5            G5
Oh I know, I'm being used
A5            F5        C5            G5
That's okay man cause I like the abuse
A5      F5       C5             G5
Oh I know, she's playing with me
A5         F5              C5            G5
That's okay cause I've got no self esteem

[Chorus]
   A5    F5   C5     G5
Oh hey yeah,  yeah yeah yeah
A5  F5  C5   G5
 Ohhhh yeah yeah
A5  F5  C5   G5
 Ohhhh yeah yeah
A5  F5  C5   G5
 Ohhhh yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
A5          F5 C5             G5
We make plans, go out at night
A5           F5       C5                G5
I wait till 2, then I turn out the light
A5          F5    C5           G5
This rejection's, got me so low
A5            F5       C5               G5
She keeps it up I just might tell her so

[Chorus]
   A5    F5   C5     G5
Oh hey yeah,  yeah yeah yeah
A5  F5  C5   G5
 Ohhhh yeah yeah
A5  F5  C5   G5
 Ohhhh yeah yeah
A5  F5  C5   G5
 Ohhhh yeah yeah

[Refrain]
D5         Bb5     F5            C5        D5
When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
       Bb5            F5             C5     
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
D5         Bb5     F5           C5       D5
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
       Bb5             F5         C5
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
D5     Bb5    F5             C5      D5
Well I guess, I should stick up for myself
      Bb5               F5          C5   D5
But I really think it's better this way
             Bb5    C5               G5            F5
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care
        G5 C5 G5 C5 G5
Right? Yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 2]
A5   F5   C5   G5
A5   F5   C5   G5

A5           F5  C5             G5
Now I'll relate, this little bit
A5              F5         C5           G5
That happens more than I'd like to admit
A5         F5     C5               G5
Late at night she knocks on my door
A5             F5     C5              G5
She's drunk again and looking to score
A5     F5  C5             G5
Oh I know, I should say no but
A5              F5           C5         G5
It's kind of hard when she's ready to go
A5          F5     C5             G5
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
A5            F5       C5            G5
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

[Chorus]
   A5    F5   C5     G5
Oh hey yeah,  yeah yeah yeah
A5  F5  C5   G5
 Ohhhh yeah yeah
A5  F5  C5   G5
 Ohhhh yeah yeah
A5  F5  C5   G5
 Ohhhh yeah yeah

[Refrain]
D5         Bb5     F5            C5        D5
When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
       Bb5            F5             C5     
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
D5         Bb5     F5           C5       D5

        G5 C5 G5 C5 G5
Right? Yeah-eh-eh
