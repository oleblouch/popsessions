[Verse 1] 0:19
DM7
    You know I'm impatient
                 E
So why would you   leave me waiting outside the station?
                                       DM7
When it was like minus 4 degrees and I

I get what you're saying
       E
I just   really don't want to hear it right now
                                      DM7
Can you shut up for like once in your life?

Listen to me
                            E
I took your nice words of advice about

How you think I'm gonna die

Lucky if I turned 33
                 DM7
Okay, so yeah, I smoke like a chimney

I'm not skinny and I pull a Britney
            E
Every other week

But cut me some slack
                      DM7
Who do you want me to be?

[Chorus] 0:54
DM7
'Cause I'm too messy
                         E
And then I'm too fucking clean

You told me, "Get a job"
                                DM7
And you ask where the hell I've been

And I'm too perfect
                   E
'Til I open my big mouth

I want to be me
              DM7
Is that not allowed?

And I'm too clever
                         E
And then I'm too fucking dumb

You hate it when I cry
                             DM7
Unless it's that time of the month

And I'm too perfect
                         E
'Til I show you that I'm not

A thousand people I could be for you
                         DM7
And you hate the fucking lot
                     E
You hate the fucking lot
                     DM7
You hate the fucking lot
     E     E
Hey, hey

[Verse 2] 1:45
D
  It's taking you ages
                E
You still don't   get the hint

I'm not asking for pages

But one text or two would be nice
D
  And please, don't pull those faces
           E
When I've,   I working like every day
                                D
It's just one bottle of wine or two

But hey, you can't even talk
                                E
You smoke weed just to help you sleep

Then why you're out getting stoned at 4 o'clock
                            D
And then you come home to me

And don't say hello
                   E
'Cause I got high again
                                 DM7
And forgot to fold my clothes....clothes

[Chorus] 2:21
DM7
'Cause I'm too messy
                         E
And then I'm too fucking clean

You told me, "Get a job"
                                DM7
And you ask where the hell I've been

And I'm too perfect
                   E
'Til I open my big mouth

I want to be me
              DM7
Is that not allowed?

And I'm too clever
                         E
And then I'm too fucking dumb

You hate it when I cry
                             DM7
Unless it's that time of the month

And I'm too perfect
                         E
'Til I show you that I'm not

A thousand people I could be for you
                         DM7
And you hate the fucking lot
                     E
You hate the fucking lot
                     DM7
You hate the fucking lot

[Chorus] 3:29
DM7
'Cause I'm too messy
                         E

You hate the fucking lot
                     DM7
You hate the fucking lot

You hate the fucking lot
