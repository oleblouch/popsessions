[Intro]
D   Am   Em   C G

[Verse 1]
D                           Am
 Say it ain't so, Joe please, say it ain't so.
Em                                        C               G
 That's not what I wanna hear Joe, ain't I got a right to know?
D                           Am
 Say it ain't so, Joe please, say it ain't so.
Em                                            C                 G
 I'm sure they're telling us lies Joe; please, tell us it ain't so.

[Verse 2]
     D
They told us that our hero has played his trump card;
   Am
He doesn't know how to go on.
      Em
We're clinging to his charm and determined smile,
        C                  G
But the good ol' days have gone.

[Interlude]
D   Am   Em   C G

[Verse 3]
    D
The image and the Empire may be falling apart;
    Am
The money has gotten scarce,
Em
One man's word held the country together,
        C                G
But the truth is getting fierce.
D                           Am
 Say it ain't so, Joe please, say it ain't so.
Em                                         C            G
 We pinned our hopes on you Joe and they're ruining our show.

Yes, we're gonna get turned, we're gonna get learned.
