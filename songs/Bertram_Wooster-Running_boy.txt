Running boy meets with the uncanny wild watch


		F
I’m running fast,
	Dm
Don’t want to arrive late
	Am		
You’re by the bus stop, near
C
The alley.
Out of battery,
I can’t call you this time
But I’ll try to arrive
Not too late 

Gm		C	F		Dm
You will be there, no reason to hurry up
Bb		C
As fast as I can, I am running

I know you won’t
Get mad for such a thing,
But you’re standing alone
I’ll make it.
I will arrive
Almost on time, I swear
And you won’t count over 99.

Refrain presque sans instru (que les premiers temps)
 
Don’t care about
This dog shitting down there,
Them two who are yelling
I don’t care
Don’t care about
That sky that just turned black
That crash that just happened
I don’t care

Fin (x2) : F 	- C - Dm - Am - Bb - F - C
