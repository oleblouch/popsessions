[Chorus 1]

A
  Let me take you down,
                  Em7
'cause I'm going to

Strawberry fields
F#7
  Nothing is real
    D              F#7
And nothing to get hung about
Dmaj7                A
Strawberry fields forever


[Verse 1]

E*        Emaj7     E7
Living is easy with eyes closed
F#m      E               D
Misunderstanding all you see
D             E               A
 It's getting hard to be someone,
                  F#m
but it all works out
D           E              D   A
 It doesn't matter much to me


[Chorus 2]

A
  Let me take you down,
                  Em7
'cause I'm going to

Strawberry fields
F#7
  Nothing is real
    D              F#7
And nothing to get hung about
Dmaj7                A
Strawberry fields forever


[Verse 2]

E*        Emaj7        E7
No one, I think, is in my tree
F#m         E               D
 I mean, it must be high or low
D             E                     A
 That is, you can't, you know, tune in
           F#m
But it's alright
D           E                  D   A
 That is, I think it's not too bad


[Chorus 3]

A
  Let me take you down,
                  Em7
'cause I'm going to

Strawberry fields
F#7
  Nothing is real
    D              F#7
And nothing to get hung about
Dmaj7                A
Strawberry fields forever


[Verse 3]

E*      Emaj7   E7
Always, no, sometimes, think it's me
F#m               E                D
 But, you know, I know when it's a dream
D             E               A
 I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes
             F#m
But it's all wrong
D           E            D   A
 That is, I think I disagree


[Chorus 4]

A
  Let me take you down,
                  Em7
'cause I'm going to

Strawberry fields
F#7
  Nothing is real
    D              F#7
And nothing to get hung about
Dmaj7                A     F#m
Strawberry fields forever
Dmaj7               A
Strawberry fields forever
Dmaj7      E         D
Strawberry fields forever
