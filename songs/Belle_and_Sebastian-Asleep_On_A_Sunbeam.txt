[Intro]

D   A   G   D   x2


[Verse 1]

D                                           A
When the half light makes for a clearer view
Bm              G
Sleep a little more if you want to
     E                 A         G         D
But restlessness has seized me now, it's true
D                                             A
I could watch the dreams flicker in your eyes
Bm           G
Lying here asleep on a sunbeam
 E              A   G          A              G        A
I wonder if you realise you fascinate me so

[Verse 2]

D                             A
Think about a new destination
Bm               G
If you think you need inspiration
     E               A        G     D
Roll out the map and mark it with a pin
D                            A
I will follow every direction
Bm                G                           E               A
Just lace up your shoes while I'm fetching a sleeping bag, a tent...


[Chorus]

  G              A
Another summer's passing by
G             E           A               G         F#
All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet
          G                  E
A walk on sand, a fire I can warm my hands
   A                 D
My joy will be complete

[Verse 3]

D                                A
I thought about a new destination
Bm                 G
I'm never short of new inspiration
     E               A        G     D
Roll out the map and mark it with a gin
D                                     A
Made my plans to conquer the country
Bm                     G                   E
I'm waiting for you to get out of your situation
           A      G         A
With your job and with your life


[Chorus]

G             E           A              G           F#
All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet
          G
A walk on sand
              E
A fire, I can warm my hands
   A               D
My joy will be complete


[Short riff - if playing alone, playing D-A-G here works well to get you to the final chorus]


[Chorus]

 G               A
Another summer's passing by
G             E            A             G             F#
All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet
          G
A walk on sand,
             E
A fire I can warm my hands
   A               D
My joy will be complete
