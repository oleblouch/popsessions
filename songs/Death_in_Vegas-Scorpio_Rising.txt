[Verse]
D                  F
When you kiss the base o'my spine
C                G            D  D  D  D
    Make my body into your shrine
     D                   F
You give me this feeling deep inside
C               G            D  D  D  D
One that I can no longer disguise
       D                  F
While other snakes just shed their skins
C              G               D  D  D  D
Forked tongues pointing out my sins
D                F         C             G       D  D  D  D
Even though I realise that history's not on my side
D                 F        C             G       D  D  D  D
Even though I realise the pioneer skin still curls up in my eyes

[Chorus]
D       F        C             G      D F C G
   If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind
   D      F     C           G       D F C G
I saw a life before me but now I'm blind
   D           F            C            G
I wanna go to heaven, never been there before
   D           F             C            G
I wanna go to heaven, so you kill me some more

D             F
Flying high upon the gallows
C                G                 D  D  D  D
Too messed up to step out of the shadows
  D                      F
A drugged up heart that knows no sorrow
C                 G          D  D  D  D
Rescued from this deep dark hole
D                         F
Stick on these boots and sharpen the nails
C                    G       D  D  D  D
Time is nigh for you leather girls
D                F
Maybe we should end this race
C                 G                D  D  D  D
  Vanish while we cannot leave no trace

    D                      F            C                G
See one-arm film stars on alien beaches Potted gold and tattooed faces
D                F              C               G
Harrison murals on the corner, tupperware boxes full of hops
D                      F                      C               G
Diazepam dreams there catching streams  Paper dinosaurs flash blue and green
D           F    C          G
Still I've got a flash-bulb head
D           F    C          G      D D D  D
Still I've got a flash-bulb head

I saw a life before me but now I'm blind
   D           F            C            G
I wanna go to heaven, never been there before
   D           F             C            G
I wanna go to heaven, so you kill me some more

Come along nice, come along dead  Scorpio rising, and paint it red
   D          F              C      G
A psychic equalizer in your head
