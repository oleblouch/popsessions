[Intro]

B B Am E G F A# C#


[Verse 1]

B                     B            Am          E
   Do you feel like a chain store? Practically floored
G              F    A#               C#        
   One of many zeros, kicked around, bored
B                                B      Am               E
   Your ears are full but you're empty, holding out your heart
G                      F     A#            A
   To people who never really care how you are


[Chorus]

           C#m            B   A
So give me Coffee and TV, easily
     C#m              E
I've seen so much I'm going blind
        A           A/C#   B
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
C#m               B               A
Sociability, it's hard enough for me
C#m                    E
Take me away from this big bad world
     A       A/C#   D                   A
And agree to marry me, so we can start over again


[Verse 2]

B                   B           Am         E
   Do you go to the country? It isn't very far
G                                F       A#                 C#
   There's people there who will hurt you 'cause of who you are
B                              B                 Am                   E
   Your ears are full of their language; there's wisdom there, you're sure
G                       F       A#                      A
   Till the words start slurring and you can't find the door


[Chorus]

           C#m            B   A
So give me Coffee and TV, easily
     C#m              E
I've seen so much I'm going blind
        A           A/C#    B
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
C#m               B               A
Sociability, it's hard enough for me
C#m                    E
Take me away from this big bad world
     A       A/C#  D                   A
And agree to marry me, so we can start over again

[Chorus]

           C#m            B   A
So give me Coffee and TV, easily
     C#m              E
I've seen so much I'm going blind
        A           A/C#   B
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
C#m               B               A
Sociability, it's hard enough for me
C#m                    E
Take me away from this big bad world
     A       A/C#   D                   A
And agree to marry me, so we can start over again


[Outro]

B  D                    A
   Oh... We could start over again
B  D                    A
   Oh... We could start over again
B  D                    A
   Oh... We could start over again
B  D                    A
   Oh... We could start over again

B D A
