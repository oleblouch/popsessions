           TAB for Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm (Crash Test Dummies)
           Tabbed by Bernardo Siu (bsiu@malloco.ing.puc.cl)
           Added To UG By Mikhailo

(CAPO ON 3RD FRET)

        This is the way I play this song on my accoustic. The following
tab is based on the chords given by Liz Myers.

        For each chord written below, play the following sequence:

     C               Am              G               F
e|---------0-----|---------0-----|---------3-----|---------1-----|
B|---1-----1--1--|---1-----1--1--|---3-----3--3--|---1-----1--1--|
G|---0--------0--|---2--------2--|---4--------4--|---2--------2--|
D|------2--------|------2--------|------5--------|------3--------|
A|---3-----------|---0-----------|---------------|---------------|
E|---------------|---------------|---3-----------|---1-----------|

     G#              Em              Bm
e|---------4-----|---------0-----|---------2-----|
B|---4-----4--4--|---0-----0--0--|---3-----3--3--|
G|---5--------5--|---0--------0--|---4--------4--|
D|------6--------|------2--------|------4--------|
A|---------------|---------------|---------------|
E|---4-----------|---0-----------|---2-----------|

    Dm              Cmaj7(Add F)
e|---------1-----|---------0-----|
B|---3-----3--3--|---0-----0--0--|
G|---2--------2--|---0--------0--|
D|------0--------|------3--------|
A|---0-----------|---3-----------|
E|---------------|---------------|

So if the chords are, say, Am G G C you should play:

     Am            G              G               C
e|---------0-------------3--------------3---------------0-----|
B|---1-----1--0----3-----3--3-----3-----3--0------1-----1--1--|
G|---2--------0----4--------4-----4--------0------0--------0--|
D|------2-------------5--------------5---------------2--------|
A|---0--------------------------------------------3-----------|
E|-----------------3--------------3---------------------------|

[Intro]


Em Bm Em Bm F G F G

Am   G                 C   C
Once    there was this kid who
F           C            G                C
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
    F    F          G    C
But when he finally came back
G   C    F               C      G     G       G
His hair had turned from black into bright white
   G#               C
He said that it was from when
    G#               Cmaj7(Add F) Cmaj7(Add F) F F
The cars had smashed soooo                     hard

[CHORUS]

Em     Bm   Em     Bm      F    G    F    G
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm, Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm

Am   G                C    C
Once   there was this girl who
F              C               G            C
Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
    F    C              G    C
But when   they finally made her
G    C    F         C        G    G    G
They saw    birthmarks all over her body
    G#               C
She couldn't quite explain it
    G#             Cmaj7(Add F) Cmaj7(Add F) F F
They'd always just been                      there


[CHORUS]

Em     Bm   Em     Bm      F    G    F    G
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm, Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm

Am   G                C    C
Once   there was this girl who
F              C               G#           C
Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
    F    C              G    C
But when   they finally made her
G    C    F         C        G    G    G
They saw    birthmarks all over her body
    G#               C
She couldn't quite explain it
    G#             Cmaj7(Add F) Cmaj7(Add F) F F
They'd always just been                      there


[BRIDGE]

Dm        Dm  C    G      G
Both girl and boy were glad
Dm        Dm   C      G   F          G
One kid had it worse than that
       Am   G             C   C
'Cause then   there was a boy whose
F                C                 G            C
Parents made him come right home directly after school
    F    C            G     C
And when they went to their church
G    C     F        C        G            G       G
They shook   and lurched all over the church floor
   G#               C
He couldn't quite explain it
       G#          Cmaj7(Add F) Cmaj7(Add F) F     F
They'd always just gone                      there


PLAY CHORUS TWICE

Outro is the same progression as the bridge. As my guitar doesn't have a
built-in fade-out :-), I end this song like this:

                                       C
                                    e|---|
                          (slower)  B|-1-|
Dm Dm C G Em Bm Em Bm     F       G G]|-0-|        Let ring the last chord
                                    D|---
                                    A|-3-|
                                    E|---|
