[Verse 1]

Gm                         C
Street's like a jungle, so call the police
F                           Eb         F#  F
Following the herd, down to Greece, on holiday
Gm                C
Love in the 90's, is paranoid
F                          Eb       F#      F
On sunny beaches take your chances, looking for

Avoiding all work, 
        C
'cause there's none available
     F                             
Like battery thinkers, 
            Eb                   F#  F
count your thoughts on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, fingers
Gm                 C
Nothing is wasted, only reproduced
    F                       
You get nasty blisters, 
        Eb                             F#   F
du bist sehr schön, but we haven't been introduced
