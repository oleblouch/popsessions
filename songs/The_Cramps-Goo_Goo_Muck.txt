[Verse 1]
          E        D          E       D
When the sun goes down and the moon comes up

E D E D

    E           D       E      D
I turn into a teenage goo goo muck,

E D E D

     A                G          A       G
I cruise through the city and I roam street

A G A G

  E              D             E      D
looking for something that is nice to eat

E D E D


[Chorus]
N.C.
you better duck

B B B B
           
N.C.    
when I show up

A A A A
               
N.C.            E   D   E  D  B7
the goo goo muck.

(and Everything Starts Again)


[Verse 2]
          E         D              E       D
I'm the night headhunter looking for some head
          E         D              E       D
with a way out body underneath that head,
     A                G          A       G
well I'll get you baby with a little luck
          E         D              E       D
cause I'm teenage tiger and a goo goo muck


[Chorus]
N.C.         B B B B
you better duck
N.C.         D D D D
when I show up
N.C.          E D E D
the goo goo muck


[Verse 3]
      E          D          E   D
the city is a jungle and I'm a beast
         E          D          E   D
I'm a teenage tiger looking for a feast,
     A                G          A       G
I want the most but I'll take the least,
                E          D          E   D
cause I'm a goo goo muck tiger and a teenage beast


[Chorus]
N.C.         B B B B
you better duck
N.C.         D D D D
when I show up
N.C.          E D E D
the goo goo muck
