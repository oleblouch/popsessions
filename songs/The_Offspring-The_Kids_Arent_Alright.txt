[Intro]

Em, C, G, D


[Verse]

Em                                         C
When we were young the future was so bright (Woah-oh!)
                                 G
The old neighborhood was so alive (Woah-oh!)
                                      D
And every kid on the whole damn street (Woah-oh!)

Was gonna make it big and not be beat

Em                                     C
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (Woah-oh!)
                                              G
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn (Woah-oh!)
                         D
How can one little street

Swallow so many lives


[Chorus]

        Em
Chances thrown
          C
Nothing's free
        G                D
Longing for what used to be
           Em
Still it's hard
        C
Hard to see
        G                D
Fragile lives, shattered dreams


[Verse]

Em
Jamie had a chance, well she really did (Woah-oh!)
C
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids (Woah-oh!)
G
Mark still lives at home cause he's got no job
D
Just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot
 
Em                   C
Jay committed suicide (Woah-oh!)
                     
Brandon OD'd and died (Woah-oh!)
G
What the hell is going on
D
cruelest dream, reality


[Chorus]

        Em
Chances thrown
          C
Nothing's free
        G                D
Longing for what used to be
           Em
Still it's hard
        C
Hard to see
        G                D
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
 
        Em
Chances thrown
          C
Nothing's free
        G                D
Longing for what used to be
           Em
Still it's hard
        C
Hard to see
        G                D
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
