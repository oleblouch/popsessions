[Verse 1]
D                         A                            Bm
I got a gnome in the backyard I put him right on the X mark
                                         Gm
He's supposed to show me where the money is  hey won't you show me where the money is?
D                               A                                    Bm
I got it all on the back of my hand I want your answer so I won't forget
                                    Gm
Then show me right where your heart is   oh right now tell me where your heart is

[Chorus]
D               A                  Bm
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy oh Mandy, oh Mandy
                 Gm
So Dreamy, Oh Mandy so killing, oh Mandy

[Verse 2]
D                             A
Sure I had trouble from the onset
                                   Bm
I tried to chase things I couldn't get
                       Gm
Show me a rerun on the W  Show me a rerun on the WB
D                          A
So what's it like to be in it
                        Bm
And move away to the Midwest
                             Gm
I gotta message for your auntie I gotta message for your auntie

[Chorus]
D               A                  Bm
Oh Mandy, Oh Mandy Oh Mandy, Oh Mandy
                 Gm
So Dreamy, oh Mandy so killing, oh Mandy
D                    A                   Bm
Can read me, and has me oh Mandy, oh Mandy's
                  Gm
Completely out of reach.

[Bridge]
Gm                                 Bb
And now I know Im at the end of my wits
                                      D
Don't gotta tell me where this is going
                                 A
Cause I know nothing ever falls apart
                                Bb
Yeah I know nothing ever falls apart
                                     Gm
Remind me once more where this is going

Before I fling it out into the ocean
D                           Gm
It's kind of level but its wavy its looking more blue than it is green
D                            Gm
It's looking quiet as I jump in so I can finally hear you scream

[Verse 3]
D                          A                               Bm
You got a gnome in the backyard you put him right on the X mark
                                        Gm
You're eating brains out the back of my head oh yeah, that's where the money is

[chorus]
D               A                  Bm
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy oh Mandy, oh Mandy
                   Gm
So dreamy, oh Mandy. so killing, oh Mandy
D               A                    Bm
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy so dreamy and has me
D               A        Bm
Oh Mandy oh Mandy, oh Mandy's
                  Gm
Completely out of reach.
