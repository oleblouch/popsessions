CAPO @ 3rd fret
--------------------------------

Em 022000    G    320003
A  002220    G/F# 200033
C  032010    B7   021200


[Intro]
Em
      One, two, three, four
Em   A   C   G


[Verse 1]
Em                   A
If you feel like a liar 
                      C
If you're about to leave me
                        G
If you can't sleep at night 
Em                    A
If my bad songs upset you
                           C
And if my arms can't warm you 
                      G
and you just have to try 


[Chorus]
B7             C
I am such a coward 
                 G
I could win an award 
G/F#                Em
You may not believe me
 G         B7      C       A        C      G   G/F#
But it would be okay, be okay, be okay  mmmh...


[Verse 2]
Em                           A
Did you know you're still cryin' 
                             C
Did you know that we're all dead 
            G
Is it paradise? 
Em                       A
I'm just waiting for the day 
                       C
that I would find a letter 
               G
On the bedroom door


[Chorus]
B7             C
I am such a coward
                 G
I could win an award
G/F#                Em
You may not believe me
 G         B7      C       A        C      G   G/F#
But it would be okay, be okay, be okay  mmmh...

I'm not very sure about the chorus but I think
it's almost the same as the song on youtube!
