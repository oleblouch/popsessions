[Elisa]

     Gm               Cm Gm 
They call me The Wild Rose
       Bb             D7
But my name was Elisa Day
         Gm                  Cm Gm
Why they call me it I do not know
       Gm         F   Gm
For my name was Elisa Day 


[He]
         Gm                    Bb
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
    Cm                     D7
She stared in my eyes and smiled
        Gm                         Bb
For her lips was the color of the roses
     Cm                       D
They grew down the river, all bloody and wild 


[Elisa]
        Gm                     Bb
When he knocked on my door and entered the room
      Cm                 D7
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
         Gm                   Bb
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
   Cm                      D               D
He wiped up the tears that ran down my face 


[Both]

     Gm               Cm Gm 
They call me The Wild Rose
       Bb             D7
But my name was Elisa Day
         Gm                  F Gm
Why they call me it I do not know
       Gm         F   Gm
For my name was Elisa Day 


[He]
        Gm                        Bb
On the second day I brought her a flower
             Cm                 D7
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
         Gm                    Bb
I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow
   Cm                    D
So sweet and scarlet and free?" 


[Elisa]
       Gm                        Bb
On the second day he came with a single red rose
          Cm                         D7
He said: "give me your loss and your sorrow?"
  Gm                   Bb
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
     Cm                      D
If I show you the roses will you follow? 


[Both]

     Gm               Cm Gm 
They call me The Wild Rose
       Bb             D7
But my name was Elisa Day
         Gm                  Cm Gm
Why they call me it I do not know
       Gm         F   Gm
For my name was Elisa Day 


[Elisa]
       Gm                          Bb
On the third day he took me to the river
   Cm                         D7
He showed me the roses and we kissed
        Gm                       Bb
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
   Cm                       D
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist 


[He]
       Gm                            Bb
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
    Cm                        D7
She lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
      Gm                             Bb
And I kissed her goodbye, said, "All beauty must die"
      Cm                      D                     D
And I lent down and planted a rose between her teeth 


[Elisa]
     Gm               Cm Gm 
They call me The Wild Rose
       Bb             D
But my name was Elisa Day
         Gm                  Cm Gm 
Why they call me it I do not know
       Gm         F   Gm
For my name was Elisa Day
       Gm         F   Gm
For my name was Elisa Day
       Gm         F   Gm
For my name was Elisa Day
