How many special people change
Asus2/G
How many lives are living strange
Asus2/F#                              Asus2/E
Where were you while we were getting high

Asus2
   Slowly walking down the hall
Asus2/G
Faster than a cannonball
Asus2/F#                              Asus2/E
Where were you while we were getting high

caught beneath the landslide
     Asus2/F#                   Asus2/E
in a champagne supernova in the sky
                 Asus2
Someday you will find me
                   Asus2/G
caught beneath the landslide
     Asus2/F#               Asus2/E
In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova in the

Wake up at dawn and ask her why
Asus2/G
A dreamer dreams, she never dies
Asus2/F#                              Asus2/E
Wipe that tear away now from your eye

We don't know why............why, why, why, why
