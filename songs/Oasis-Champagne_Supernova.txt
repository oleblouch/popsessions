How many special people change
Asus2/G
How many lives are living strange
Asus2/F#                              Asus2/E
Where were you while we were getting high
Asus2
   Slowly walking down the hall
Asus2/G
Faster than a cannonball
Asus2/F#                              Asus2/E
Where were you while we were getting high

[Chorus]

Someday you will find me
                   Asus2/G
caught beneath the landslide
     Asus2/F#                   Asus2/E
in a champagne supernova in the sky
                 Asus2
Someday you will find me
                   Asus2/G
caught beneath the landslide
     Asus2/F#            
In a champagne supernova,

a champagne supernova in the sky

Wake up at dawn and ask her why
Asus2/G
A dreamer dreams, she never dies
Asus2/F#                              Asus2/E
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Asus2
   Slowly walking down the hall

But you and I, we live and die,

the world's still spinning round

We don't know why............
why, why, why, why
