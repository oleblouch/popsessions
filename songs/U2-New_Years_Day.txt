[Verse 1]
Am      C      Em
All is quiet on New Year's Day
Am         C           Em
A world in white, gets underway
Am        C                       Em
I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Am      C         Em          Am
Nothing changes on New Year's Day
    Em
On New Year's Day


[Chorus]
G               Am
I will be with you again
G               F   Am         C  Em
I will be with you again


[Verse 2]
Am      C         Em
Under a blood red sky
Am          C        Em
A crowd has gathered, black and white
Am      C      Em
Arms entwined, the chosen few
Am              C    Em               G
Newspaper say, says, say it's true, it's true
Am
And we can break through
        G                  F
Though torn in two, we can be one


[Chorus]
G          Am
I, I will begin again
G          F           Am     C  Em  Am
I, I will begin again, yeah


[Chorus/Outro]
G               Am
I will be with you again
G               F   Am         C  Em
I will be with you again
