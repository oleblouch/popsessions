There was a pretty good one already on here but there was an E on the chorus
in that one where I've put a C#m, I think this way is correct. There are a
couple of tabs with the intro on too so I won't bother with that. It's best
to just play around with it if you're playing lead. The chords are pretty
basic. The pattern for the verse can be a bit of a pain at first but other
than that it's all very straight forward.


[Verse]
A
Tender is the night
G             A
Lying by your side
A
Tender is the touch
   G                A
Of someone that you love too much
A
Tender is the day
    G          A
The demons go away
A
Lord I need to find
G               A
Someone who can heal my mind


[Chorus]
A                     D      C   
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,     get through it
A                     C#m             D
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,     love's the greatest thing
(Repeat once) 

C#m       D
That we have
C#m                   D
I'm waiting for that feeling
C#m               D
Waiting for that feeling
A                G          A
Waiting for that feeling to come

Oh my baby, oh my baby, oh why, oh my


[Verse]
 A
Tender is the ghost
 G                    A 
The ghost I love the most
 A  
Hiding from the sun
  G              A 
Waiting for the night to come
A
Tender is my heart
     G              A 
I'm screwing up my life
 A
Lord I need to find
 G                       A 
Someone who can heal my mind

(Repeat once)

That we have
C#m                   D

Waiting for that feeling
A                G          A

Damon plays the chords barred but I think the B and high E strings are open.
That sounds great if you've got the full band playing but if it's just one
guitar, you're better off sticking to the standard chords.
