[Intro]

[Verse 1]
              C       Cmaj7/G C
No New Year`s day, to cele -  brate,
   Cmaj7/G   C                             Dm
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away.
DmM7          Dm   DmM7             Dm7
  No first of spri-ing,  no song to sing,
DmM7             Dm    Dm7    Gsus4 G    C     C*
  In fact here`s just another ordi- nary day.

[Verse 2]
         C        Cmaj7/G C
No April rain, no flowers bloom,
   Cmaj7/G C                            Dm
No wedding Saturday within the month of June.
DmM7          Dm DmM7             Dm7
  But what it i- is, is something true,
DmM7         Dm          Dm7        Gsus4  G      C     C*
  Made up of these three words that I must say to you.

[Chorus]
       Dm        G     C            C
I just called to say I love you,
       Dm        G              Am      Am
I just called to say how much I care.
       Dm        G     Am        Am
I just called to say I love you,
      Dm7              Gsus4  G     C         C*
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

[Verse 3]
            C        Cmaj7/G C
No summer`s high, no warm  July,
   Cmaj7/G C                               Dm
No harvest moon to light one tender August night.
DmM7        Dm DmM7            Dm7
  No autumn breeze, no falling leaves,
DmM7       Dm                Gsus4  G        C     C*
  Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.

[Verse 4]
         C       Cmaj7/G C
No Libra Sun, no Hallo - ween,
   Cmaj7/G C                                   Dm
No giving  thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
DmM7          Dm    DmM7               Dm7
  But what it i-i-i-is, though old, so new.
DmM7           Dm         Dm7      Gsus4       G    C     C*
  To fill your heart like no three words could ever do.

[Chorus] (key change)
       Ebm       Ab    Db         Db
I just called to say I love you.
       Ebm       Ab             Bbm          Bbm
I just called to say how much I ca-a-are, I do.
       Ebm       Ab    Bbm       Bbm
I just called to say I love you.
      Ebm              Absus4 Ab    Db
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

[Chorus] (another key change)
       Em        A     D          D
I just called to say I love you.
       Em        A              Bm      Bm
I just called to say how much I care.
       Em        A     Bm       Bm
I just called to say I love you.
      Em               Asus4  A     D
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

[Coda]

Bb    C      C     | D | % | % | D   D D D
Of my heart, of my heart.
