Em

[Verse]

         Em                 Em G C
It's the time, of the season
                   Em
When the love runs high
        Em                      Em G C 
In this time, give it to me easy
           Em                  G
And let me try, with pleasured hands,
                   Em               G
To take you in the sun to promised lands,
                 Em
To show you everyone

[Chorus]

Em   D   C           G          Am  E
It's the time of the season for loving
