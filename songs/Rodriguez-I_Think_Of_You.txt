[Verse 1]

Amaj7
Just a song we shared, I'll hear
Bm7                  Esus4        E
Brings memories back when you were here
Amaj7
Of your smile, your easy laughter
Bm7           Esus4        E
Of your kiss, those moments after


[Chorus]

Amaj7
I think of you
Bm7
And think of you
Amaj7
And think of you

Bm7  Esus4  E


[Verse 2]

Amaj7
Of the dreams we dreamed together
Bm7             Esus4     E
Of the love we vowed would never
Amaj7
Melt like snowflakes in the sun
Bm7              Esus4       E
My days now end as they begun


[Chorus]

Amaj7
With thoughts of you
Bm7
And I think of you
Amaj7
And think of you

Bm7  Esus4  E


[Bridge]

Bm7                 C#m7
Down the streets I walked with you
Bm7            C#m7
Seeing others doing
            E
Things we do

Esus4  E


[Verse]

Amaj7
Now these thoughts are haunting me
Bm7              Esus4     E
Of how complete, I used to be
Amaj7
And in these times that we're apart
Bm7                  Esus4       E
I'll hear this song that breaks my heart


[Outro]

Amaj7
And think of you
Bm7
And I think of you
Amaj7
And think of you
Bm7
And I think of you
Amaj7     Bm7    Esus4   E
And I do

Amaj7
