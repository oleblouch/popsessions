The night we met I knew I needed you so

And if I had the chance I'd never let you go

Every place we go

(Be my, be my baby) Be my little baby
                                            F
(My one and only baby) Say you'll be my darling

C                          Dm             G
For every kiss you give me I'll give you three

You know I will adore you

Till eternity
