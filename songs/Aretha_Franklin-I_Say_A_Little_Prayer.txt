[Intro] (keys accent high A)
F#m   D   D   E A   D   C#7
(say a little prayer for you)
(keys line walk down pickup C# B A)

[Verse]
F#m                Bm
    The moment I wake up
             E     A
Before I put on my makeup
   D                       C#7
I say a little (prayer for you)
F#m                      Bm
    And while combing my hair, now,
                    E        A
And wondering what dress to wear, now,
   D                      C#7
I say a little prayer for you

[Chorus]
   D        E            C#m         F#m
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
            A7
and I will love you
   D        E        C#m         F#m
Forever, forever, we never will part
            (A7)    D  D/A
Oh, how I'll love you
  D         E              C#m         F#m
Together, together, that's how it must be
            (E)     Bm A
To live without you
      D D  D  D/E  D/E   D   C#7          riff: C# C# B A G# F# F D
Would only be heartbreak for me.

[Verse]
F#m                Bm
    I run for the bus, dear,
                E       A
While riding I think of us, dear,
  D                       C#7
I say a little prayer for you.
F#m                    D
    And at work I just take time
                   E       A
And all through my coffee break-time, (break-time!)
  D                       C#7
I say a little prayer for you.

[Chorus]

and I will love you

Forever, forever, we never will part
            A7
Oh, how I'll love you
  D         E              C#m         F#m
Together, together, that's how it must be
            A7
To live without you
      D D  D  D/E  D/E   D   C#7
Would only be heartbreak for me.    (Nobody but me)

   D        E            C#m         F#m

My darling, believe me,
