The Letter - The Box Tops

[Verse 1]
Am                      F
Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
G                        D
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Am                    F
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
         E                    Am
Cause my baby just wrote me a letter


[Verse 2]
Am                            F
I don't care how much money I gotta spend
G                     D
Got to get back to my baby again
Am                    F
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
   E                    Am
My baby just wrote me a letter


[Chorus]
         C          G
Well she wrote me a letter
         F        C            G
Said she couldn't live without me no more
C             G
Listen mister can't you see
  F          C            G
I got to get back to my baby once more
E
Anyway


[Verse 3]
Am                      F
Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
G                        D
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Am                    F
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
         E                    Am
Cause my baby just wrote me a letter


[Chorus]
         C          G
Well she wrote me a letter
         F        C            G
Said she couldn't live without me no more
C             G

Ain't got time to take a fast train
Am                    F
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
         E                    Am
Cause my baby just wrote me a letter
         E                    Am
Cause my baby just wrote me a letter
