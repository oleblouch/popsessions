[Intro]

D            Em
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
D/F#         G       A
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


[Verse]

D           
Uptown girl
Em                        D/F#
 She's been living in her uptown world
G          A           D
 I bet she never had a back street guy
Em                    D/F#
 I bet her mama never told her why
G          A
 I'm gonna try for an


[Verse]
D
Uptown girl
Em                        D/F#
 She's been living in her white bread world
G           A           D
 As long as anyone with hot blood can
Em                           D/F#
 And now she's looking for a downtown man
G              A
 That's what I am


[Bridge]

Bb           Gm
And when she knows what
    Cm             F
She wants from her time
Bb           Gm
And when she wakes up
    Am7-5        D7
And makes up her mind
G              Em
She'll see I'm not so tough
Am
Just because
A
I'm in love with an


[Chorus]

D
Uptown girl
Em                             D/F#
 You know I've seen her in her uptown world
G              A            D
 She's getting tired of her high class toys
Em                             D/F#
 And all the presents from her uptown boys
G            A
 She's got a choice


[Interlude]

F            G               E               Am      G
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
F            G               E               A
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


[Verse]

D
Uptown girl
Em                          D/F#
 You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
G          A               D
 But maybe someday when my ship comes in
Em                              D/F#
 She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
G              A
 And then I'll win


[Bridge]

Bb             Gm
And when she's walking
      Cm         F
She's looking so fine
Bb             Gm
And when she's talking
       Am7-5          D7
She'll say that she's mine
G              Em
She'll say I'm not so tough
Am
Just because
A
I'm in love with an


[Verse]

D
Uptown girl
Em                         D/F#
 She's been living in her white bread world
G           A           D
 As long as anyone with hot blood can
Em                           D/F#
 And now she's looking for a downtown man
G              A
 That's what I am


[Interlude]

F            G               E               Am      G
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
F            G               E               A
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


[Outro]

D
Uptown girl
Em               D/F#
 She's my uptown girl
    G           A
You know I'm in love
        D
With an uptown girl
Em          D/F#
My uptown girl
    G           A
You know I'm in love
        D
With an uptown girl
Em          D/F#
My uptown girl
    G           A
You know I'm in love
        D
With an uptown girl
Em          D/F#
My uptown girl
