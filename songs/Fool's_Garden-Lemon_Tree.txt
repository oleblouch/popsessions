[Verse 1]
Em                Bm
I'm Sitting Here In A Boring Room
Em                             Bm
It's Just Another Rainy Sunday Afternoon
Em                        Bm
I'm Wasting My Time I Got Nothing To Do
Em                     Bm
I'm Hanging Around I'm Waiting For You
Bbm    Am                   Bm      Em   Bm   Em
But Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder

Em                Bm
I'm Driving Around In My Car
Em                             Bm
I'm Driving Too Fast I'm Driving Too Far
Em                        Bm
I'd Like To Change My Point Of View
Em                        Bm
I Feel So Lonely I'm Waiting For You
Bbm    Am                   Bm      Em   Bm   Em
But Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder

[Chorus]
G              D
I Wonder How I Wonder Why
Em                              Bm
Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The Blue Blue Sky
C/G                  D                    G         D7
And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree
G                   D
I'm Turning My Head Up And Down
Em                                  Bm
I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning Turning Around
C/G                  A7                    D7
And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree

[Verse 2]
Em                Bm
I'm Sitting Here I Miss The Power
Em                             Bm
I'd Like To Go Out Taking A Shower
Em                        Bm
But There's A Heavy Cloud Inside My Head
Em                        Bm
I Feel So Tired Put Myself Into Bed
Bbm   Am                   Bm      Em   Bm   Em
Where Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder

[Bridge]
B7           Em
Isolation - Is Not Good For Me
D7           G               B7
Isolation - I Don't Want To Sit On A Lemon-tree

[Verse 3]
Em                Bm
I'm Steppin' Around In A Desert Of Joy
Em                Bm
Baby Anyhow I'll Get Another Toy
Bbm  Am                Bm                       Em   Bm   Em
And Everything Will Happen - And You'll Wonder

[Chorus]
G              D
I Wonder How I Wonder Why
Em                              Bm
Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The Blue Blue Sky
C/G                  D                    G         D7
And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree
G                   D
I'm Turning My Head Up And Down
Em                                  Bm
I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning Turning Around
 C/G                  A7             D7
And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree
 D
And I wonder I wonder

G              D
I Wonder How I Wonder Why
 Em                              Bm
Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The Blue Blue Sky
 C/G                  D
And All That I Can See
 C/G                  D
And All That I Can See
  C                  D7
And All That I Can See
                   G
Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree.
