           C        F         C
When you're weary,     feeling small
F      Bb    F    C       F           C         F   C   F
  When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all

  I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough

  And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled wa-ter
       E7      Am
I will lay me down
C7     F      F#dim  C      A7sus A7  F
Like a bridge over troubled wa-ter

I will lay me down

When you're down and out
                    C     F
When you're on the street
     Bb F     C        F
When evening falls so hard
       C        F   C   F
I will comfort you
C      G    Am   G7
  I'll take your part

Oh, when darkness comes

Like a bridge over troubled wa-ter
       E7      Am
I will lay me down

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down

  I'm sailing right behind
