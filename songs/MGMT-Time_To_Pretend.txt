D                           G                             D Dsus2 D
I'm Feelin rough I'm Feelin raw I'm in the prime of my life.

Let's make some music make some money find some models for wives.

I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars.
D                           G                        D Dsus2 D    
You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars.


[Pre-chorus 1]

G                       
This is our decision to live fast and die young.
                                           D Dsus2 D Dsus2
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
G                           
Yeah it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
                                                    D Dsus2 D Dsus2
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?


[Chorus 1]

A                                 F#m
Forget about our mothers and our friends.
        G      A     D
We were fated to pretend.
        G           D
              to pretend.
        G           D
We were fated to pretend.
        G           D
              to pretend.

I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms.
D                           G                                D Dsus2 D
I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world.
D                            G                             D Dsus2 D
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home.

Yeah I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone.


[Pre-chorus 2]

G                            
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do.
                                                  D Dsus2 D Dsus2
Love must be forgotten. Life can always start up anew.
G                              
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce,
                                                       D Dsus2 D Dsus2
we'll find some more models, Everything must run its course.


[Chorus 2]

A                                              F#m
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end.
        G     A      D
We were fated to pretend.
        G           D
              to pretend.
        G           D
We were fated to pretend.
        G           D
              to pretend.
