A little bit different version of the Doobie Brothers Classic, Long Train 
Running.  This version makes it a bit easier for people that aren't so good with 
their barre chords.  But it's also just a really cool arrangement for solo acoustic players!

Tuning: Standard Tuning  â€“ Capo 3


[Intro]

Em7


[Verse]

Em7
Down around the corner half a mile from here
see them long trains run and you watch them disappear


[Chorus]

        Am7                     Em7
without love where would you be now
        C   C/B   B7    Em7
without love


[Verse]

Em7
Though I saw miss lucy down along the track
she lost her home and her family and she won t be coming back


[Chorus]

        Am7                     Em7
without love where would you be now
        C   C/B   B7    Em7
without love


[Verse]

Em7
with the Illinois Central and the Southern Central freight
you got to keep on pushing Mama,  you know they're running late


[Chorus]

        Am7                     Em7
without love where would you be now
        C   C/B   B7    Em7
without love


[Verse]

when the pistons keep on churning and the wheels go round and round
and the steel rails are cold and hard for the miles that they go down


[Chorus]

        Am7                     Em7
without love where would you be now
        C   C/B   B7    Am7
without love            oohhhhh where would you be..


[Outro]

Em7
