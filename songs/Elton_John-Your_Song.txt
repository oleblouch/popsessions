[Verse 1]
D                 Gmaj7  A/C#             F#m
It's a little bit funny,   this feeling inside
Bm             Bm/A       Bm/G#      Gmaj7
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
D                  A        F#         Bm
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did
D             Em7        G               A
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

D             Gmaj7  A/C#              F#m
If I was a sculptor,   but then again, no
     Bm            Bm/A       Bm/G#         G
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
   D             A                 F#        Bm
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
D              Em7     G                D
My gift is my song, and this one's for you


[Chorus]
A/C#              Bm      Em7            Gmaj7
And you can tell everybody this is your song
A/C#       Bm            Em               G
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
Bm                    Bm/A
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Bm/G#                G6
That I put down in words,
      D/F#    Em            G             A
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 2]
D            Gmaj7  A/C#                 F#m
I sat on the roof     and kicked off the moss
        Bm          Bm/A              Bm/G#           Gmaj7
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
D                    A        F#                   Bm
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
D                    Em7     G                A
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

D               Gmaj7    A/C#                F#m
So excuse me forgetting,   but these things I do
Bm               Bm/A              Bm/G#             Gmaj7
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
D                  A                 F#     Bm
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
D               Em7        G              D
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen


[Chorus]
A/C#              Bm      Em7            G
And you can tell everybody this is your song
A/C#       Bm            Em               G
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
Bm                    Bm/A
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Bm/G#                G6
That I put down in words,
      D        Em            G              A
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

Bm                   Bm/A
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Bm/G#                G6
That I put down in words,
     D/F#     Em            G             D       G/D   A/D   G/D   D
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
