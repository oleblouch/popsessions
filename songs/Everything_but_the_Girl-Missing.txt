[Intro]

Am


[Verse]

Am
I step off the train
Em7
Walking down your street again
Am
Past your door
    G
But you don't live there anymore
Am
It's years since you've been there
Em7                            Am
And now you've disappeared somewhere

Like outer space
G
You've found some better place


[Chorus]

           Am F
And I miss you
         G                 Dm
Like the deserts miss the rain
           Am F
And I miss you
         G                 Dm
Like the deserts miss the rain


[Verse]

Am
Could you be dead?
    Em7
You always were two steps ahead
Am
Of everyone
     G
We'd walk behind while you would run
Am
I look up by your house
Em7                           Am
And I can almost hear you shout down to me
G
Where I always used to be


[Chorus]

           Am F
And I miss you
         G                 Dm
Like the deserts miss the rain
           Am F
And I miss you
         G                 Dm
Like the deserts miss the rain


[Verse]

Am
Back on the train
Em7
I ask why did I come again
Am
Can I confess
G
I've been hanging 'round your old address
        Am
And the years have proved
Em7
To offer nothing since you moved
Am
Your long gone
G
but I can't move on


[Chorus]

           Am F
And I miss you
         G                 Dm
Like the deserts miss the rain
           Am F
And I miss you, yeah
         G                 Dm
Like the deserts miss the rain


[Verse]

  Am
I step off the train
    Em7
I'm walking down your street again
Am
Past your door
        G
I guess you don't live there anymore
Am
It's years since you've been there
Em7
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Am
Like outer space
G
You've found some better place


[Chorus]

           Am F
And I miss you
       G                    Dm
Like the deserts miss the rain
           Am F
And I miss you
         G                 Dm  Am F
Like the deserts miss the rain
         G                 Dm   Am F
Like the deserts miss the rain
         G                 F
Like the deserts miss the rain
