This is my interpretation of the song.  I know that the original
music as written by Franz Gruber is different than this.


G                         D7           G
Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright
C                 G                 C              G
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child, holy infant so tender and mild
D7                G               D7       G
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace


G                         D7              G
Silent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the sight
C                   G            C                   G
Glories stream from heaven afar, heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
D7                   G     G          D7        G
Christ the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born


G                         D7          G
Silent night, holy night, Son of God, love's pure light
C                  G              C                  G
Radiant beams from Thy holy face, with the dawn of redeeming grace
D7                 G            D7           G
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth, Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
