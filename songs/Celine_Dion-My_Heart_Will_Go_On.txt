[Verse 1]

E              B
Every night in my dreams
  A          E    B
I see you, I feel you
E             B           A
that is how I know you go on.
E              B
Far across the distance
    A      E       B
and spaces between us
E                B           A
you have come to show you go on.


[Chorus]

C#m   B        A        B
Near, far, wherever you are
  C#m              B             A
I believe that the heart does go on.
C#m  B         A        B
Once more, you open the door
           C#m        B
and you're here in my heart and
   A             B      E
my heart will go on and on.


[Verse 2]

                  B
Love can touch us one time
    A          E   B
and last for a lifetime
E         B                 A
and never let go till we're gone.
E               B              A         E      B
Love was when I loved you, one true time I hold to
E                B         A
In my life we'll always go on.


[Chorus]

C#m   B        A        B
Near, far, wherever you are
  C#m              B             A
I believe that the heart does go on.
C#m  B         A        B
Once more, you open the door
           C#m        B
and you're here in my heart
       A             B      C#m B A
and my heart will go on and on.
