[Verse 1]

           Am         Ammaj9
There’s a lady who’s sure,
         Am7          D/F#
All that glitters is gold.
          Fmaj7                G Am
And she’s buying a stairway to Heaven.
         Am              Ammaj9
When she gets there she knows,
       Am7             D/F#
If the stores are all closed,
       Fmaj7                     G  Am
With a word she can get what she came for.

C    D   Fmaj7 Am             C        G           Dsus4 D
  Oo-ooh ooh - ooh, and she’s buying a stairway to Hea - ven.


[Verse 2]

          C            D
There’s a sign on the wall,
        Fmaj7        Am
But she wants to be sure.
           C              D              Fmaj7
‘Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
     Am            Ammaj9
In a tree by the brook,
          Am           D/F#
There’s a songbird who sings,
          Fmaj7                      G Am
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

[Bridge 1]

Am7    D                 Am7     Em/D D C/D D
       Ooh, it makes me wonder...
Am7     D                   Am7    Em/D D C/D D
Oooooooooh, it makes me wonder...


[Verse 3]

          C          G/B
There’s a feeling I get,
       Am
When I look to the west.
       C         G/B        Fmaj7 Am
And my spirit is crying for lea - ving.
      C               G/B
In my thoughts I have seen,
         Am
Rings of smoke through the trees,
        C         G/B             Fmaj7 Am     C G/B
And the voices of those who stand loo - king.


[Bridge 2]

Am7     D                       Am7    Em/D D C/D D
  Oooooooh, it makes me wonder...
Am7         D                          Am7    Em/D D C/D D
Oooooooooh, it really makes me wonder...


[Verse 4]

         C              G/B
And it’s whispered that soon,
      Am
If we all call the tune,
         C          G/B        Fmaj7 Am
Then the piper will lead us to rea - son.
      C             G/B
And a new day will dawn,
    Am
For those who stand long,
        C            G/B       Fmaj7 Am    C G/B
And the forests will echo with laugh-ter.

[Verse 5]

C              G/B            Am
  If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow

Don’t be alarmed now,
C             G/B                  Fmaj7 Am
  It’s just a spring clean for the May   queen.
C                G/B               Am
  Yes, there are two paths you can go by

But in the long run
C               G/B                Fmaj7 Am          C G/B
  There’s still time to change the road  you’re on.


[Bridge 4]

Am7    D                   Am7     Em/D D C/D D
          And it makes me wonder...
Am7    D         Am7    Em/D D C/D D
       Ohhh-ohhh


[Verse 6]

C              G/B            Am
  Your head is humming and it won’t go

In case you don’t know,
C             G/B            Fmaj7 Am
  The piper’s calling you to join  him,
C            G/B               Am
  Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,

And did you know
C               G/B         Fmaj7 Am        C G/B D
  Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

[Final Verse]

Am           G                F
  And as we wind on down the road,
Am            G                F
  Our shadows taller than our souls,
Am               G           F
  There walks a lady we all know,
Am                 G                  F
  Who shines white light and wants to show,
Am           G                   F
  How everything still turns to gold.
Am           G            F
  And if you listen very hard,
Am               G             F
  The tune will come to you at last.
Am             G              F
  When all are one and one is all, yeah.
Am         G           F
  To be a rock and not to roll.
