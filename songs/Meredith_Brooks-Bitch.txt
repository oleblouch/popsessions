[Intro]

A   E* D    x2


[Verse 1]

  A
I hate the world today
E* D                           A
     You're so good to me, I know but I can't change
E* D                           F#m
     Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
       Bm               D
I'm an angel underneath, innocent and sweet


[Verse 2]

A
Yesterday I cried
E* D                                A
     You must have been relieved to see the softer side
E* D                      F#m                   Bm  
     I can understand how you'd be so confused, I don't envy you
      D
I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one


[Chorus]

      A                         E
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother
      Bm                     D
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed
         A                         E
I'm your hell, I'm your dream, I'm nothing in between
             F#m                        D
You know you wouldn't want it any other way


[Verse 3]

   A
So take me as I am
E* D                              A
     This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
E* D                          F#m
     Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
         Bm                  D
And I'm going to extremes, tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing


[Chorus]

      A                         E
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother
      Bm                     D
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed
         A                         E
I'm your hell, I'm your dream, I'm nothing in between
             F#m                        D
You know you wouldn't want it any other way


[Solo]

A   E   F#m  D
A   E   Bm   D


[Bridge]

E
  Just when you think you got me
                F#m                  D
Figured out the season's already changin'
E                       F#m               D
  I think it's cool you do what ya do and don't try to save me


[Chorus]

      A                         E
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child, I'm a mother
      Bm                     D
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint, I do not feel ashamed
         A                         E
I'm your hell, I'm your dream, I'm nothing in between
             F#m                        D
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

      A                         E
I'm a bitch, I'm a tease, I'm a goddess on my knees
         Bm                              D
When you hurt, when you suffer, I'm your angel undercover
          A                        E
I've been numb, I'm revived, can't say I'm not alive
           F#m                         D
You know I wouldn't want it any other way


[Outro]
Woohoo
A   E   F#m   D
Woohoo
A   E   F#m   D
