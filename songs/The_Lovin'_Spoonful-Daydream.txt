The Lovin Spoonful 1966 (Daydream)

Capo I

[Verse 1]

C

C                A7
What a day for a daydream
Dm7               G
 What a day for a daydreamin' boy
C                  A7
 And I'm lost in a daydream
Dm7               G
 Dreamin' bout my bundle of joy

F            D7                C     A7
 And even if time ain't really on my side
F                  D7                C       A7
 It's one of those days for takin' a walk outside
F                D7            C           A7
 I'm blowin' the day to take a walk in the sun
    G                             G7
And fall on my face on somebody's new-mowed lawn

[Verse 2]

C                A7
 I been havin' a sweet dream
Dm7                      G
 I been dreamin' since I woke up today
C                        A7
 It's starring me and my sweet thing
Dm7                                 G
 'Cause she's the one that makes me feel this way

F            D7                 C    A7
 And even if time is passin' me by a lot
F                D7             C                 A7
 I couldn't care less about the dues you say I've got
F              D7               C           A7
 Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load
  G                           G7
A pie in the face for bein' a sleepy bull toad

 A daydream will last 'til long into the night
F            D7                C             A7
 Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
G                                        G7
Or you may be daydreamin' for a thousand years

 And I'm lost in a daydream

 Dreamin' bout my bundle of joy
