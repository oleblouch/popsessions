OVER MY SHOULDER by Mike & The Mechanics

Notes:
The Em chord I think is called Em7 but if not it should be
like this: 022033 (with the 1st string occasionally muted)

Capo 1


[Intro]

Em7  A  D   x2


[Verse 1]

        Em7  A       D
Looking back over my shoulder
Em7            A            D
I can see that look in your eyes
Em7             A           D
I never dreamed it could be over
Em7           A            D
I never wanted to say good bye


[Verse 2]

        Em7  A       D
Looking back over my shoulder
Em7            A          D
With an aching deep in my heart
Em7       A             D
I wish we were starting over
Em7                       A      D
Oh instead we're drifting so far apart


[Bridge]

C      G/B  F/A              G
  Everybody told me you were leaving
C       G/B      F/A            G
  Funny I should be the last to know
C       G/B     F/A              G
  Baby, please, tell me that I'm dreaming
Am                           Bb
I just never want to let you go


[Verse 3]

        Em7  A       D
Looking back over my shoulder
Em7            A            D
I can see that look in your eyes
Em7              A        D
Turning my heart over and over
Em7            A           D
I never wanted to say good bye


[Bridge]

C         G/B  F/A       G
  I don't mind everybody laughing
C           G/B      F/A              G
  But it's enough to make a grown man cry
C              G/B         F/A                 G
  'cause I can feel you're slipping through my fingers
Am                           Bb
I don't even know the reason why

Em7   A   D
Em7   A   D
Em7   A   D
Em7   A   D


[Bridge]

C      G/B F/A           G
  Everyday it's a losing battle
C         G/B       F/A             G
  Just to smile and hold my head up high
C          G/B F/A         G
  Could it be  we belong together
Am                               Bb    C Dm C/E
Baby, won't you give me one more try?
Fsus2         Gsus4
 One more try


[Verse 4]

        Em7  A       D
Looking back over my shoulder
Em7            A            D
I can see that look in your eyes
Em7             A           D
I never dreamed it could be over
Em7            A           D
I never wanted to say good bye


[Verse 5]

        Em7  A       D
Looking back over my shoulder
Em7               A          D
ThereÂ´s an aching feeling inside
Em7            A          D
Cutting me up, deeper and deeper
Em7                     A            D
Fills me with a sadness that I can't hide
