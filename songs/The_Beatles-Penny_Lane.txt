Penny Lane chords
The Beatles  1967 (Magical Mystery Tour) *

Capo II

[Verse 1]

         A               F#m            Bm          E7
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
         A                 F#m              Am
of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to have known
                                 F           E7
And all the people that come and go stop and say hello

[Verse 2]

       A           F#m           Bm       E7
On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
           A                 F#m            Am
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
                             F          E7            D
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, very strange.

[Chorus]

      G             Bm             C    trumpet (G  Bm  C)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                 Bm            C               E7
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]

         A               F#m             Bm         E7         A
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass and in his pocket is a
F#m             Am
portrait of the queen.
                                 F             E7
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.

[Interlude] (piccolo trumpet)

A  F#m  D6  E  A  F#m  Am7
F#m7  Fmaj7  Esus4  E    D

[Chorus 2]

      G             Bm             C   (G  Bm  C)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                      Bm     C              E7
    A four of fish and finger pies in summer meanwhile back

[Verse 4]

           A              F#m           Bm        E7
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
           A                F#m            Am
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
                                      F
And though she feels as if she's in a play
       E7
She is anyway.

[Verse 5]

         A               F#m            Bm       E7
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer.
           A               F#m           Am
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
                            F           E7
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain,
D
very strange.

[Chorus]

      G             Bm             C   (G Bm C)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                 Bm            C               E7
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back

[Outro]

A                   C#m            D    (A  C#m  D)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A                 C#m           D     (A  C#m  D)
There beneath the blue suburban skies.
      A
Penny Lane
