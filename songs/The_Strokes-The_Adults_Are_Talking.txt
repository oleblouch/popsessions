[Intro]
Gm  C7  F  Bbmaj7
Gm  C7  F


[Verse 1]
             F
They've been saying
                Dm
"You‘re sophisticated"
           F
They're complaining
       Dm
Overeducated
        F
You are saying
                   Dm
All the words I'm dreaming
             C/E
Say it after me
             C7/E
Say it after me


[Verse 2]
          F
They will blame us
            Dm
Crucify and shame us
         F
We can‘t help it
            Dm
If we are a problem
       F
We are trying
                 Dm
Hard to get your attention
                     C/E
I'm climbing up your wall
                     C7/E
Climbing up your wall


[Chorus]
Gm
Don‘t go there 'cause you'll never return
           C7
I know you think of me when you think of her
             F
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
          Bbmaj7
To do the right thing but without recompense
             Gm
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
            C7
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
               F
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
             Bbmaj7
But then you want me to do the same as you


[Instrumental]
F  Dm  x3

C/E C7/E


[Verse 3]
          F
You were waitin'
          Dm
For the elevator
         F
You were sayin'
                  Dm
All the words I'm dreaming
        F
No more askin'
             Dm
Questions or excuses
              C/E
Information's here
              C7/E
Here and everywhere


[Chorus 2]
Gm
Don‘t go there 'cause you'll never return
           C7
I know you think of me when you think of her
             F
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
          Bbmaj7
To do the right thing but without recompense
             Gm
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
            C7
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
               F
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
             Bbmaj7
But then you want me to do it the same way as you


[Bridge]
Gm                     C7
I don't - I don't want anything
F               Bbmaj7
  I know it's not
              Gm
It's not your fault
             C7
I don't want anyone
F       Bbmaj7
  As I do, it's not for
Gm
You

[Outro]
Gm                      C7
Same shit different life
                       F
I‘ll get it right some time
            Bbmaj7
Maybe not tonight
            Gm
Maybe not tonight
            C7
Maybe not tonight
            F
Maybe not tonight
            Bbmaj7
Maybe not tonight
