[Intro]
G


[Verse]
G                      B
Sittin' in the morning sun
        C                C B Bb  A
I'll be sittin' when the evening come
G                       B
Watching the ships roll in
          C               C B Bb A
then I'll watch 'em roll away   again, yeah


[Chorus]
         G                          E
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
             G          E
watching the tide roll away
        G                          A
ooo I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
        G    E
wasting ti---ime


[Verse]
G                 B
I left my home in Georgia and I
C              C   B Bb A
Headed for the Frisco   bay
G                          B
'Cause I've got nothing to live for
C                         C    B Bb A
Look like nothing's gonna come my   way


[Chorus]
         G                          E
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
             G          E
watching the tide roll away
        G                        A
ooo I'm sittin' on the dock of a bay
        G    E
wasting ti---ime


[Bridge]
G  D         C
   Look like nothing's gonna change
G       D     C
   Everything seems to stay the same
G  D               C          G
   I can't do what ten people tell me to do
F                    D
   So I guess I'll remain the same


[Verse]
G                       B
Sittin' here resting my bones
         C                C     B  Bb A
and this loneliness won't leave me a--lone
      G            B
These 2000 miles I roamed
        C         C    B Bb A
just to make this dock my   home


[Chorus]
    G                          E
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
             G          E
Watching the tide roll away.  ooo
G                          A
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
            G    E
I'm wasting ti---ime


[Outro]
