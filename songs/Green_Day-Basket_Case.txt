Green Day
Basket Case

[Verse]
Eb               Bb
Do you have the time
Cm                Gm
To listen to me whine
Ab                 Eb                Bb
About nothing and everything all at once
Eb            Bb
I am one of those
Cm              Gm
Melodramatic fools
Ab                Eb               Bb
Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it

[Chorus]
Ab           Bb              Eb
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Ab           Bb                Eb
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
Ab              Bb
It all keeps adding up
Eb             Db    Cm
I think I'm cracking up
Ab             Bb
Am I just paranoid?
            Eb
I'm just stoned

[Interlude]

[Verse]
Eb               Bb
I went to a shrink
Cm                Gm
To analyze my dreams
Ab                 Eb                Bb
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
Eb            Bb
I went to a whore
Cm              Gm
He said my life is a bore
Ab                Eb               Bb
And quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

[Chorus]
Ab           Bb              Eb
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Ab           Bb                Eb
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
Ab              Bb
It all keeps adding up
Eb             Db    Cm
I think I'm cracking up
Ab             Bb
Am I just paranoid?
            Eb
I'm just stoned

[Bridge]
Ab             Bb
Grasping to control

So I better hold on

[Instrumental]

Eb   Bb   Cm   Gm   Ab   Eb   Bb

[Chorus]
Ab           Bb              Eb
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Ab           Bb                Eb
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
Ab              Bb
It all keeps adding up
Eb             Db    Cm
I think I'm cracking up
Ab             Bb
Am I just paranoid?
            Eb
I'm just stoned
