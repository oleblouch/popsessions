[Intro]
G C G Em

[Verse 1]
G                 C
Name on the line, last request
G                    Em
Pull the car over to find some rest
D
Saying “I love you”
Bm                C
Need to lie here, need to leave
G                     Em
Living in the debt of make believe
Am
Saying I owe you
C
Crooked as a crow gnawing on dawn
G                            Em
Shadow from the grass in the dirt on the lawn
Am        C
Why do I string you along?

[Chorus]
D                   G   C   D
 My certainty is wild, weaving
                    G   C   D
For you I am a child, believing
                    D7           G
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
       C       D
In the future

[Verse 2]
G                 C
Sit on the phone, watch TV
G                Em
Romance, action, mystery
D
Wanted to show you
Bm             C
Sine wave is a particle ride
G                         Em
Bring your light out then in on the tide
Am
Maybe I love you
C
Maybe I love you is a river so high
G                     Em
Maybe I love you is a river so low
Am           C
I love you, still don’t know

[Chorus]
D                   G   C   D
 My certainty is wild, weaving
                    G   C   D
For you I am a child, believing
                    D7           G
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
       C       D
In the future

[Instrumental Break]
G C G Em D
Bm C G Em Am 
C G Em Am C

[Chorus]
D                   G   C   D
 My certainty is wild, weaving
                    G   C   D
For you I am a child, believing
                    D7           G
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
       C       D
In the future
