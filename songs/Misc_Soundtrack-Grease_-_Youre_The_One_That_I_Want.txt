[Verse 1]

      Am                                   F         C
I got chills, they're multiplyin', and I'm losin' control
           E               Am
'Cause the power you're supplyin', it's electrifyin'


[Pre-chorus 1]

                 C            Em        Am                       F
You better shape up, 'cause I need a man, and my heart is set on you
                 C              Em        Am                      F
You better shape up, you better understand, to my heart I must be true
                      F
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do


[Chorus]

           C                                                 F
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C                                                 F
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C                                                 F
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
          G                               G7
The one I need (the one I need), oh yes indeed (yes indeed)

[Verse 2]

          Am                                F         C
If you're filled with affection, you're too shy to convey
    E            Am
Meditate in my direction, feel your way


[Pre-chorus 2]

               C             Em
I better shape up, cause you need a man (I need a man)
Am                      F
   who can keep me satisfied
               C          Em
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove (You better prove)
Am                       F
   that my faith is justified

Are you sure?
         F
Yes, I'm sure down deep inside


[Chorus]

           C                                                 F
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C                                                 F
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C                                                 F
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
          G                               G7
The one I need (the one I need), oh yes indeed (yes indeed)
