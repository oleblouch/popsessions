[Verse 1]
G          Em
I, I gotta new life,
           C          D                G
You would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad
             Em     C       D            G
How could a person like me care for you?
         Em            C             D           G
Why do I bother when you're not the one for me?
     Am      D
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

Is enough enough?

[Chorus]
G          Em          C            D               G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
          Em       C           D
Life is demanding without understanding
G          Em          C            D                G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
               Em                  C                    D         C
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
     D
But where do you belong?

[Verse 2]
G          Em
Under the pale moon
       C            D                G
For so many years I wondered who you are
            Em     C        D          G
How could a person like you bring me joy?
          Em              C       D           G
Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars
     Am      D
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

Is enough enough?

[Chorus]
G          Em          C            D               G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
          Em       C           D
Life is demanding without understanding
G          Em          C            D                G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
               Em                  C                    D         C
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
     D
But where do you belong?

[Chorus]
G          Em         C                D
I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
         G                    Em 
And I am happy now living without you
     C          D
I've left you, oh, oh, oh,oh
G         Em           C            D                  G
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
               Em                 C                    D
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
G          Em
I saw the sign
   C         D
I saw the sign
G          Em
I saw the sign
       C            D          N.C.
And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
