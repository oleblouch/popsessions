Jimmy was ill, he just stood still
                        Bb
to breathe and clean his mind up
    Gm              C
the souvenir is way too far
                F
but remains as a scar

Clouds were low, air was cold,
                        Bb 
night is falling, it doesn’t help (for sure)
    Gm                  C 
« love is not all around you »
                F
that’s how he felt

[CHORUS]
Dm   C
All is gone

A bookshop turned its light on,
                        Bb
« It’s been so long » Jimmy sighed
    Gm              C
I have not been reading anything else
                F
than  « the far side »

F
The shop was pretty, intimate and warm,
                        Bb
Jimmy pushed the door
    Gm              C
Dazzled by the glow, he almost fell
                F
on the guest author

[CHORUS]
Dm   C
All is gone

« How to turn the page » was the title
                        Bb
The writer laid her eyes on him
    Gm              C
Her book was a part of a cycle
                F
as the first volume
