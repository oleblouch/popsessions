FEMME FATALE
The Velvet Underground


[Verse 1]
Cmaj7    Fmaj9
Here she comes
Cmaj7                 Fmaj9
You better watch your step
Cmaj7          F                   Dm        G
She's goin' to break your heart in two, it's true
Cmaj7               Fmaj9
It's not hard to realize
     Cmaj7                       Fmaj9
Just look into her false colored eyes
Cmaj7            F                  Dm           G
She'll build you up to just put you down, what a clown


[Chorus]
              C                                 F
Cos everybody knows            (she's a femme fatale)
                       C                        F
The things she does to please  (she's a femme fatale)
                    C                           F
She's just a little tease      (she's a femme fatale)
                     Dm                         Bb      G
Just see the way she walks and hear the way she talks


[Verse 2]
Cmaj7                 Fmaj9
You're written in her book
       Cmaj7             Fmaj9
You're number 37, have a look
Cmaj7          F                  Dm           G
She's goin' to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Cmaj7                      Fmaj9
Little boy, she's from the street
  Cmaj7                         Fmaj9
Before you start you're already beat
Cmaj7          F               Dm             G
She's goin' to play you for a fool, yes it's true


[Chorus]
              C                                 F
Cos everybody knows            (she's a femme fatale)
                       C                        F
The things she does to please  (she's a femme fatale)
                    C                           F
She's just a little tease      (she's a femme fatale)
                     Dm                         Bb      G
Just see the way she walks and hear the way she talks

              C                                 F
Cos everybody knows            (she's a femme fatale)
                       C                        F
The things she does to please  (she's a femme fatale)
                    C                           F
She's just a little tease      (she's a femme fatale)
            C                                   F
Oh oh-oh oh-oh                 (she's a femme fatale)
            C                                   F
Oh oh-oh oh-oh                 (she's a femme fatale)
