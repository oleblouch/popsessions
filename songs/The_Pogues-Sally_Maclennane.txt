[Verse 1]
     D                             G               D
Well Jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born
   D                                    G              A
He played it from the night-time to the peaceful early morn
   G                                D               A
He soothed souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
         D               G            A  D
And they all looked very happy in the morning

[Verse 2]
    D                           G                D
But Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
          D                                               G            A
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks when he'd had too many powers
   G                              D             A
So sad to see the grieving of the people he was leaving
       D                 G                A  D
And he took the road for God knows in the morning

[Chorus]
   D                 G              D
We walked him to the station in the rain
   D                G              A
We kissed him as we put him on the train
       G          D                  G
And we sang him a song of times long gone
          D                 A           D    A      D
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again, (far away!)
(D)
Sad to say I must be on my way
   G               D                  A                     D
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away, (far away!)
    (D)
I'd like to think I'll be returning when I can
       G               D             A           D
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane

[Verse 3]
    D                                       G            D
The years passed by the times had changed I grew to be a man
  D                                    G          A
I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally MacLennane
  G                                        D                    A
I took the jeers and drank the beers and I crawled back home at dawn
    D          G             A  D
And ended up a barman in the morning

[Verse 4]
  D                                    G               D
I plied the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down
  D                                  G                 A
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown
  G                                  D          A
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away
     D               G              A  D
Some people left for heaven without warning

[Chorus]
   D                  G             D
We walked him to the station in the rain
   D                G              A
We kissed him as we put him on the train
       G          D                  G
And we sang him a song of times long gone
          D                 A           D    A      D
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again, (far away!)
(D)
Sad to say I must be on my way
   G               D                  A                     D
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away, (far away!)
    (D)
I'd like to think I'll be returning when I can
       G               D             A           D
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane

[Verse 5]
     D                              G                     D
When Jimmy came back home he was surprised that they were gone
   D                               G                    A
He asked me all the details of the train that they went on
     G                                   D             A
Some people they are scared to croak but Jimmy drank until he choked
    D                 G             A  D
And took the road for heaven in the morning

[Chorus]
   D                 G              D
We walked him to the station in the rain
       D                G              A
And we kissed him as we put him on the train
       G          D                  G
And we sang him a song of times long gone
          D                 A           D    A      D
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again, (far away!)
(D)
Sad to say I must be on my way
   G               D                  A                     D
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away, (far away!)
    (D)
I'd like to think I'll be returning when I can
       G               D             A           D
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane
