[Verse]

A                 C#m
Breathe it in and breathe it out and
B                B
pass it on, it's almost out.
      A            C#m
We're so creative, so much more.
      B              B
We're high above but on the floor


[Chorus]

            E          F#sus2   Asus2
It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive...
             E              F#sus2  Asus2 (sustained)
If you don't have it you're on the other side


[Verse]

    A                   C#m
The deeper you stick it in your vein,
    B                           B
the deeper the thoughts there's no more pain.
A             C#m
I'm in heaven I'm a god.
    B            B
I'm everywhere I feel so hot.

It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive.

If you don't have it you're on the other side.
           E       F#sus2 Asus2
I'm not an addict, maybe that's a lie!

[Verse]

     A             C#m
It's over now, I'm cold, alone.
    B             B
I'm just a person on my own.
A               C#m
Nothing means a thing to me.
    B                B
Oh, nothing means a thing to me.

I'm not an addict, maybe that's a lie!


[Bridge]

E        D
Free me, leave me.

Watch me as I'm going down and
E        D
free me, see me.
B                               C         sustained
Look at me, I'm falling and I'm falling

It is not a habit, it is cool I feel alive.
