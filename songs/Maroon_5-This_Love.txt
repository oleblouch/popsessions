[Verse 1]

G                       Cm
I was so high I did not recognize
                       Fm
The fire burning in her eyes
               G7/D
The chaos that controlled my mind
G                            Cm
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
            Fm
Never to return again
                 G7/D
But always in my heart


[Chorus]

 Cm  Fm       Bb        Eb
This love has taken its toll on me
 Cm          Fm      Bb           Eb
She said Goodbye too many times before
    Cm  Fm       Bb          Eb
And her heart is breaking in front of me
 Cm       F            Ab              G
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

G                           Cm
I tried my best to feed her appetite
                Fm
Keep her coming every night
                    G7/D
So hard to keep her satisfied
G                             Cm
Kept playing love like it was just a game
              Fm
Pretending to feel the same
                     G7/D
Then turn around and leave again  (oh!)

I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
