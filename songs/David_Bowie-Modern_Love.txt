[Verse 1]
C 
I catch the paper boy 
C                         G
But things don’t really change 
                     Am
I’m standing in the wind 
                     E   E7  
But I never wave bye-bye 
F       C      G   Em  Em7
  But I try, I try 

[Verse 2]
C
There’s no sign of life 
C                       G
It’s just the power to charm 
                 Am
I’m lying in the rain 
                      E   E7
But I never waved bye-bye 
F       C      G   Em  
  But I try, I try

F 
Church on time 
C

Em 
(Church on time) - puts my trust in 
F 
God and man 
C 
(God and man) - no confessions 
D 
(God and man) - no religion 
Em 
(God and man) - don’t believe in 
F 
Modern love

C
It’s not really work 
C                      G
It’s just the power to charm 
                       Am
Still standing in the wind
                      E   E7
But I never waved bye-bye 
F       C      G   Em  
  But I try, I try
