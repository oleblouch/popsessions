[Verse]

     A            
Well East coast girls are hip
         G
I really dig those styles they wear
        D
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
              E
They knock me out when I’m down there
    A                                 G
The mid-west farmers daughters really make you feel alright
        D
And the northern girls with the way they kiss
                E
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

[Chorus]

  A                   Bm
I wish they all could be California girls
   G                   Am
(I wish they all could be Californian)
  F                   Gm            A
I wish they all could be California girls

[Verse]

    A
The West coast has the sunshine
        G
And the girls all get so tanned
        D
I dig a French bikini on Hawaii island dolls
     E
By a palm tree in the sand
  A
I been all around this great big world
         G
And I’ve seen all kinds of girls
            D
Yeah, but I couldn’t wait to get back in the states
            E
Back to the cutest girls in the world

[Chorus]

  A                   Bm
I wish they all could be California girls
   G                   Am
(I wish they all could be Californian)
  F                   Gm            A
I wish they all could be California girls

A E

[Outro]

  A                                          Bm
I wish they all could be California girls (I wish they all could be Californian) 
  A                                          Bm
I wish they all could be California girls (I wish they all could be Californian)
