[Intro]

A   Bm   D   Asus2  2x

[Verse]

 A 
25 years of my life and still
 Bm                                      D 
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
           Asus2 
for a destination.
 A 
I realized quickly when I knew I should
            Bm                                    D 
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man,
                     Asus2
for whatever that means.


[Pre-Chorus]

         A 
And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed
        Bm                                   D 
just to get all out, what's in my head, then I,
                            Asus2 
I'm feeling, a little peculiar.
           A 
And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside
      Bm                                           D 
And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, and I,
                                               Asus2 
scream from the top of my lungs, "What's going on?"

 
[Chorus]

            A                  Bm 
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus 
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
            A                  Bm 
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus2 
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"


[Interlude]

Oooh ohh... 
A   Bm   D   Asus 
Oooh ohh... 
A   Bm   D   Asus 


[Verse]

           A               Bm 
And I try, oh my god, do I try
               D                 Asus  
I try all the time, in this institution.
 A                          Bm 
And I pray, oh my god, do I pray
                    D              Asus2 
I pray every single day, for a revolution.


[Pre-Chorus]

         A 
And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed
         Bm                                  D 
just to get all out, what's in my head, then I,
                         Asus2 
I'm feeling, a little peculiar.
          A 
And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside 
      Bm                                           D 
And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, and I,
                                               Asus2 
scream from the top of my lungs, "What's going on?"
 

[Chorus]

             A                 Bm 
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus 
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
            A                  Bm 
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus 
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"

I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
            A                  Bm 
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
         D                 Asus2 
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
