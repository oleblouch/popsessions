[Intro]
Em D

[Verse 1]
  D
I  know I stand in line until you think
                              Em            A7  Em A7
You have the time to spend an  evening with  me
    Em             A7                Em
And  if we go some  place to dance I  know that
          A7                   D
There's a  chance you won't be  leaving with me

[Chorus]
    D
And  afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
           G             Bb
And have a  drink or two
    Em             A7               Em
And  then I go and  spoil it all by  saying
          A7             D
Something  stupid like I  love you

[Bridge]
      D
I can  see it in your eyes that you despise
                                 G
The same old lines you heard the  night before
    E
And  though it's just a line to you for me it's true
                    A
And never seemed so  right before

[Verse 2]
  D
I  practice everyday to find some clever lines
                   Em            A7   Em  A7
To say to make the  meaning come  true
    Em                 A7              Em            A7
But  then I think I'll  wait until the  evening gets  late
        D
And I'm  alone with you

[Chorus]
    D
The  time is right your perfume fills my head
                              G                Bb
The stars get red and oh, the  night's so blue
    Em             A7               Em
And  then I go and  spoil it all by  saying
          A7             D
Something  stupid like I  love you

[Instrumental]
D D Em A7
Em A7
Em A7 Em A7 D

[Chorus]
    D
The  time is right your perfume fills my head
                              G                Bb
The stars get red and oh, the  night's so blue
    Em             A7               Em
And  then I go and  spoil it all by  saying
          A7             D         Bb
Something  stupid like I  love you

[Outro]
  D         Bb
I  love you
  D         Bb
I  love you
  D         Bb
I  love you
  D
I  love you
