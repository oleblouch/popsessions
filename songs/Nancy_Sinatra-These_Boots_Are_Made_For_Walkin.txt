[Verse]

E
You keep sayin', you've got somethin' for me,
E
Somethin' you call love, but confess
A
You've been a-messin' where you shouldn't have been a-messin',
        E
And now someone else is gettin' all your best


[Chorus]

      G                   E
These boots are made for walkin'
    G                        E
And that's just what they'll do,
G                       E     N.C.                    E
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

[Verse]

E7
You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin',
    E7
And you keep losin' when you oughta not bet
A7
You keep samein' when you ought to be a-changin',
           E7
Now what's right is right but you ain't been right yet


[Chorus]

      G                   E
These boots are made for walkin'
    G                        E
And that's just what they'll do,
G                       E     N.C.                    E
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

[Verse]

E7
You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin',
    E7
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned, ha!
A7
I just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
    E7
And what he knows you ain't had time to learn


[Chorus]

      G                   E
These boots are made for walkin'
    G                        E
And that's just what they'll do,
G                       E     N.C.                    E
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
