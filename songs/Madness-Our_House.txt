[Intro]

C  Gm  Dm  Fm  (x3)


[Verse]

C                        Gm
 Father wears his Sunday best,
Dm                                    Fm
 Mother's tired she needs a rest, the kids are playing up downstairs.

C                        Gm
 Sister's sighing in her sleep,
Dm                                Fm
 Brother's got a date to keep; he can't hang around.


[Chorus]

D    Am     Em     Gm            D
 Our house, in the middle of our street,
    Am     Em     Gm
Our house, in the middle of our...


[Verse]

C                   Gm
 Our house it has a crowd,
        Dm                                   Fm
There's always something happening, and it's usually quite loud.

C                       Gm
 Our mum she's so house-proud.
Dm                                  Fm
 Nothing ever slows her down, and a mess is not allowed.


[Chorus]

D    Am     Em     Gm            D
 Our house, in the middle of our street,
    Am     Em     Gm
Our house, in the middle of our...

B    F#m    C#m    Em            B
 Our house, in the middle of our street,
B          F#m                   C#m         Em       B
 Something tells you that you've got to get away from it.


[Verse]

C                        Gm
 Father gets up late for work,
Dm                             Fm
 Mother has to iron his shirt, then she sends the kids to school.

C                           Gm
 Sees them off with a small kiss.
Dm                                       Fm
 She's the one they're going to miss, in lots of ways.

[Solo]

C  Gm  Dm  Fm  (x2)

D    Am     Em     Gm            D
 Our house, in the middle of our street,
    Am     Em     Gm
Our house, in the middle of our...


[Middle 8]

C
 I remember way back then, when everything was true, and when,
Gm
 We would have such a very good time;
       Dm                Fm
Such a fine time, such a happy time.

    C
And I remember how we'd play,
                           Gm
Simply waste the day away, then we'd say;
                      Dm            Fm
Nothing would come be-tween us; two dreamers.


[Verse]

C                        Gm
 Father wears his Sunday best,
Dm                                    Fm
 Mother's tired she needs a rest, the kids are playing up downstairs.

C                        Gm
 Sister's sighing in her sleep,
Dm                                Fm
 Brother's got a date to keep; he can't hang around.


[Chorus]

D    Am     Em     Gm            D
 Our house, in the middle of our street,
    Am     Em     Gm           (B)
Our house, in the middle of our street.

B    F#m    C#m    Em            B
 Our house, in the middle of our street,
    F#m    C#m    Em
Our house, in the middle of our...

C    Gm    Dm       Fm             C
 Our house, was our castle and our keep,
    Gm     Dm     Fm           (C)
Our house, in the middle of our street.

D    Am    Em        Gm               D
 Our house, that was where we used to meet,
    Am     Em     Gm           (B)
Our house, in the middle of our street.

(Fade out)
