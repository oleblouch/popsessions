[Verse 1]

    G                  C                  - G
I need love, love, to ease my mind,
  Bm        - Em            Am                   D
I need to find, find,      someone to call mine. But mama said:
 

[Chorus]

         G               C                 G 
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
 Bm                     Em   Am                   D
She said, love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take.
  G                 C                 G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait,
   Bm   Em                   Am              D
you got to trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes.
 

[Verse 2]

           Bm
But how many heartaches must I stand,
          Em 
before I find a love to let me live again.
                Am 
Right now the only thing that keeps me hangin' on,
   D                                       D7
when I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone.
 
I remember, (mama said) :
 

[Chorus]

         G                C                 G 
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
 Bm                     Em  Am                   D
She said, love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take.
G                        C             G
How long must I wait, how much more can I take,
 Bm    Em         Am                      D
before loneliness will cause my heart, heart to break?
 

[Verse 3]

        Bm
No, I can't bear to live my life alone,
     Em
I grow impatient for a love to call my own.
        Am
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
D                         D7
these precious words keep me hanging on.I remember,(mama said):
 

[Chorus]

 G                      C                 G 
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
   Bm                    Em   Am                   D
She said, love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take.
  G                      C                 G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
  Bm   Em                    Am       D          - G ~
She said trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes.
 

[Verse 4]

         G               C     - G
No, love, love, don't come easy,
   Bm       Em          Am   D
but I keep on waiting, anticipating 
 G                             C        G
for that soft voice, to talk to me at night,
   Bm      Em          Am         D
for some tender arms, to hold me tight.
     G                C      - G
I keep waiting, I keep on waiting,
    Bm    - Em           Am             D
But it ain't easy,         it ain't easy. But mama said :
 

[Chorus]

 G                 C                 G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
  Bm             Em         Am              D
She said trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes.
 G                 C                 G 
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
   Bm                     Em   Am                   D
She said, love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take...
