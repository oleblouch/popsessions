[Verse 1]
A                                          G
So no one told you life was gonna be this way
A                                                     C#m
Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A
G                Bm              A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
         G                D                     Esus4               E
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month or even your year


[Chorus]
       A       D         E
But... I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)
A       D         E
I'll be there for you (like I've been there before)
A       D         E                               G
I'll be there for you ('cause you're there for me too)


[Verse 2]
A                                           G
You're still in bed at ten, and work began at eight,
A                                                    C#m
You've burned your breakfast so far things are going great
G            Bm                    A
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
         G                D                 Esus4                    E
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees


[Chorus]
       A       D         E
And... I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)
A       D         E
I'll be there for you (like I've been there before)
A       D         E                               G
I'll be there for you ('cause you're there for me too)


[Bridge]
D
No one could ever know me, no one could ever see me
F#m
Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me
Bm                             Bm/A
Some one to face the day with, make it through all the rest with
G            D                  
Someone I'll always laugh with
E          D         E         F#m  D   E
Even at my worst I'm best with you,     yeah

[Verse 3]
G                Bm              A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
        G                D                    E
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month

Or even your year


[Chorus]
A       D         E
I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)
A       D         E      
I'll be there for you (like I've been there before)
A       D         E                               G
I'll be there for you ('cause you're there for me too)

A       D         E
I'll be there for you
A       D         E
I'll be there for you
A       D         E                               G
I'll be there for you ('cause you're there for me too)
