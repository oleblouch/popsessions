[Intro]
(one guitar)

E  Bsus4  Asus2  Bsus4

(whole band comes in)

C#m7   Bsus4  C#m7   Bsus4
Asus2  Bsus4  Asus2  Bsus4


[Verse 1]

E             Bsus4
   My name is Luka
Asus2            Bsus4
   I live on the second floor
E           Bsus4
   I live upstairs from you
Asus2                  Bsus4
   Yes, I think you've seen me before


[Chorus 1]

C#m7           Bsus4              C#m7
   If you hear something late at night
                Bsus4                  Asus2
   Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
               Bsus4
   Just don't ask me what it was
Asus2          Bsus4
   Just don't ask me what it was
Asus2          (Bsus4)
   Just don't ask me what it was


[Verse 2]

E            Bsus4
I think it's 'cause I'm clumsy
Asus2        Bsus4
I try not to talk too loud
E            Bsus4
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
Asus2        Bsus4
I try not to act too proud


[Chorus 2]

C#m7      Bsus4         C#m7
They only hit until you cry
 Bsus4                      Asus2
And after that you don't ask why
               Bsus4
You just don't argue anymore
Asus2          Bsus4
You just don't argue anymore
Asus2          (Bsus4)
You just don't argue anymore


[Solo]

E  Bsus4  Asus2  Bsus4    E  Bsus4  Asus2  Bsus4


[Verse 3]

E       Bsus4
Yes, I think I'm okay
Asus2           Bsus4
Walked into the door again
E                 Bsus4
If you ask that's what I'll say
Asus2             Bsus4
And it's not your business anyway


[Chorus 3]

C#m7      Bsus4         C#m7
I guess I'd like to be alone
 Bsus4                   Asus2
Nothing broken, nothing thrown
                 Bsus4
Just don't ask me how I am
Asus2            Bsus4
Just don't ask me how I am
Asus2            (Bsus4)
Just don't ask me how I am


[Verse 4]

E             Bsus4
   My name is Luka
Asus2            Bsus4
   I live on the second floor
E           Bsus4
   I live upstairs from you
Asus2                  Bsus4
   Yes, I think you've seen me before


[Chorus 1]

C#m7           Bsus4              C#m7
   If you hear something late at night
                Bsus4                  Asus2
   Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
               Bsus4
   Just don't ask me what it was
Asus2          Bsus4
   Just don't ask me what it was
Asus2          (Bsus4)
   Just don't ask me what it was


[Chorus 2]

C#m7      Bsus4         C#m7
They only hit until you cry
 Bsus4                      Asus2
And after that you don't ask why
               Bsus4
You just don't argue anymore
Asus2          Bsus4
You just don't argue anymore
Asus2          (Bsus4)
You just don't argue anymore
