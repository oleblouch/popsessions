[Verse 1]

Am                                  Em/G
Lili, take another walk out of your fake world
                                     Am
please put all the drugs out of your hand
                                           Em/G
you'll see that you can breathe without not back up
                              F
so much stuff you got to understand


[Chorus]

          Am
for every step in any walk
     Em/G
any town of any thought
              F
I'll be your guide

           Am
for every street of any scene
     Em/G
any place you've never been
              Em
I'll be your guide


[Verse 2]

Am                                               Em/G
Lili, you know there's still a place for people like us
                             Am
the same blood runs in every hand
                                         Em/G
you see it's not the wings that make the angel
                                       F
just have to move the bats out of your head


[Chorus]

          Am
for every step in any walk
     Em/G
any town of any thought
              F
I'll be your guide

           Am
for every street of any scene
     Em/G
any place you've never been
              Em
I'll be your guide


[Verse 3]

Am                                Em/G
Lili, easy as a kiss will find an answer
                               Am
put all your fears back in the shade
                                Em/G
don't become a ghost without no colour
                                      F
cause you're the best paint life ever made


[Chorus]

          Am
for every step in any walk
     Em/G
any town of any thought
              F
I'll be your guide

           Am
for every street of any scene
     Em/G
any place you've never been
              Em
I'll be your guide
