This is a great VU song, sung by Mo Tucker and covered I understand by 
REM. Play this on an acoustic and drop the tuning a full step.


[Chorus]

(1,2,3)
       C         A7
If you close the door
    Dm                  G
The night could last forever
          C        A7
Leave the sunshine out
    Dm             G
And say hello to never


[Verse 1]

        C                              C7
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
  F                       Fm
I wish it could happen to me
           C         A7
But if you close the door
    Dm            G            C
I'd never have to see the day again


[Chorus]

       C         A7
If you close the door
    Dm                  G
The night could last forever
          C          A7
Leave the wine glass out
    Dm               G
And drink a toast to never


[Verse 2]

    C                           C7
Oh, someday I know someone will look into my eyes
           F
And say hello
                       Fm
You're my very special one
           C         A7
But if you close the door
    Dm            G            C       (Bass line to bridge: C - B - Bb)
I'd never have to see the day again


[Bridge]

Am         E7          Am       E7
Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars
        Am        E7          Am        Am G# G
And the people on subways and trains
        Dm          A7           Dm         A7
Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed
       F                       G
Oh but people look well in the dark


[Chorus]

           C         A7
And if you close the door
    Dm                  G
The night could last forever
          C        A7
Leave the sunshine out
    Dm           G
And say hello to never


[Verse 3]

        C                              C7
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
  F                       Fm
I wish it could happen to me
             C         A7
Cause if you close the door
    Dm            G            C
I'd never have to see the day again

    Dm            G            C       A7
I'd never have to see the day again (once more)
    Dm            G            C
I'd never have to see the day again
