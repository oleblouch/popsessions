[Verse 1]
C                       Cmaj7                  C7    Cmaj7
I saw you walk down the street with some other girl, yeah.
C                    Cmaj7                     C7
Always thought that I was the only one in your world
A
Baby can you tell me so
Dm                  Dmmaj7                        Dm7   Dmmaj7
Out of sight out of mind ain't what love ought to be
Dm                  Dmmaj7                         Dm7
And I hoped all the time that you'd be faithful to me
G
You'd be faithful to me

[Chorus 1]
C                 Cmaj7                      C7
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
            A
Is to be my baby, baby
Dm                Dmmaj7
I just want to be sure
                  Dm7
That forever and more
          G
You would be my baby

[Verse 2]
C                       Cmaj7                C7    Cmaj7
Love is just like a flower baby it has to grow
C                    Cmaj7                     C7
And when you are away I'm even loving you more
A
I just have to let you know
Dm                  Dmmaj7                        Dm7   Dmmaj7
One on one is the way and that's the way it should be
Dm                  Dmmaj7                         Dm7
So if you're not gonna stay, then don't be playing with me
G
You can set me free

[Chorus 2]
C                 Cmaj7                      C7
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
            A
Is to be my baby, baby
Dm                Dmmaj7
'Cause all this love is for you
                  Dm7
And you know that I'm true
          G
And I'll be your baby

[Chorus 3]
C                 Cmaj7                      C7
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
            A
Is to be my baby, baby
Dm                Dmmaj7
'Cause you knew from the start
                  Dm7
That you were working my heart
          G
Won't you be my baby

[Verse 3]
C                       Cmaj7                C7    Cmaj7
I remember our walk the other Saturday night
C                       Cmaj7                C7    
Sweet harmonies filled and floated through our minds
A
Never felt this way before
Dm                  Dmmaj7                         Dm7   Dmmaj7
We were riding so high on love and understanding
Dm                  Dmmaj7                          Dm7
So why go wasting your time when you have got such a find
G
That is everlasting

[Chorus 4]
C                 Cmaj7                      C7
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
            A
Is to be my baby, baby
Dm                Dmmaj7
I just want to be sure 
                  Dm7
That forever and more
          G
You would be my baby

[Chorus 5]
C                 Cmaj7                      C7
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
            A
Is to be my baby, baby
Dm                Dmmaj7
'Cause all this love is for you and you know
                  Dm7
That I'm true
          G
And I'll be your baby

[Outro]
Dm Dmmaj7 Dm7                G
          And I want you to love me baby

C Cmaj7 C7 A

Dm Dmmaj7 Dm7                G
          And I want you to love me baby
