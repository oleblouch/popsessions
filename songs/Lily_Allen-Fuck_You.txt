[Verse 1]

C
look inside
                      Am
look inside your tiny mind

now look a bit harder
            Dm7
cause we're so uninspired

so sick and tired
F                      G
of all the hatred you harbor


[Verse 2]

C                               Am
so you say it's not okay to be gay

well, I think you're just evil
Dm7
you're just some racist who can't tie my laces
F                        G
your point of view is medieval


[Chorus]

C                            E
fuck you, fuck you very very much
          Am
cause we hate what you do

and we hate your whole crew
      G
so please don't stay in touch

C                            E
fuck you, fuck you very very much
           Am
cause your words don't translate

and it's getting quite late
      G
so please don't stay in touch


[Verse 3]

C                                Am
do you get, do you get a little kick out of being small-minded?
             Dm7
you want to be like your father

it's approval you're after
F                        G
well that's not how you find it


[Verse 4]

C                     Am
do you, do you really enjoy living a life that's so hateful?
                 Dm7
cause there's a hole where your soul should be

you're losing control of it
F                  G
and it's really distasteful


[Chorus]

C                            E
fuck you, fuck you very very much
          Am
cause we hate what you do

and we hate your whole crew
      G
so please don't stay in touch

C                            E
fuck you, fuck you very very much
           Am
cause your words don't translate

and it's getting quite late
      G
so please don't stay in touch

Eb
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
G
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Cm      Bb
Fuck you


[Verse 5]

 C
You say
                           Am
You think we need to go to war

Well, you're already in one
            Dm7
'Cause it's people like you that need to get slew
F                   G
No one wants your opinion


[Chorus]

C                            E
fuck you, fuck you very very much
          Am
cause we hate what you do

and we hate your whole crew
      G
so please don't stay in touch

C                            E
fuck you, fuck you very very much
           Am
cause your words don't translate

and it's getting quite late
      G
so please don't stay in touch
C
Fuck you
E
Fuck you
Am      G
Fuck you

C
Fuck you
E
Fuck you
Am      G
Fuck you
