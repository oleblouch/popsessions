[VERSE 1:]
Out where the river broke
The bloodwood and the desert oak
Holden wrecks and boiling diesels
Steam in forty five degrees

     E     E
    The time has come
E    D/E   D/E
    To say fair's fair
D/E  A/E   A/E
    To pay the rent
A/E  E     E
    To pay our share

     E     E
    The time has come
E    D/E   D/E
    A fact's a fact
D/E  A/E   A/E
    It belongs to them
A/E       F#
    Let's give it back


[CHORUS:]                                               (little riff)
Em                        C                G          E -----3--3--3--5----3
How can we dance when our earth is turning
Em                        C                D          B/D#
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
Em                        C                G          E -----3--3--3--5----3
How can we dance when our earth is turning
Em                        C                D
How do we sleep while our beds are burning


[END-CHORUS]
    Em               C
The time has come to say fairs fair
   G                    D
to pay the rent, now to pay our share


[LAST VERSE:]
Four wheels scare the cockatoos
&gt;From Kintore East to Yuendemu
The western desert lives and breathes
In forty five degrees


[Chorus]
END-CHORUS:
HALF of CHORUS:
then horn solo over end-chorus chords:


[END:]
E(no 3rd)  G A   ...             E(no 3rd)  G A  (slide down on notes)
