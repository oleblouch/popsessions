D   A   Em  G

        D 
These streets, they just don't know me
    A 
Like you seem to do
Em 
Swollen disappointments
        G
But the loneliness is new
D
Take away this crown
                                A 
Face paint's running down these walls
        Em 
And I'd like to say that I'm better now I'm home
            G
But I'm still low

D   A   Em  G

    D   
Mr. Blue, Mr. Grey, you're fine
                A
But you drag me down
                Em
And I've tried fucking every girl in town
            G
But I'm still down
        D
And it's here again today
Sticks around won't go away
        A
But it's colder than before
                Em
It does you no good
                                G
But you try to say that it's okay

        A        F#m          G
This is all you, all you know
A       F#m         G
Always, always low

D                           A
But it breaks to see it, though

D                       Em
    You're getting old, boy
        A    D 
Getting old, boy

D   E  F#m  G (x2)
Bm  E  A    D 

    Em          A
I'm already low
    Em          A
I'm al-ready low
    Em          A
I'm already low

D                   E  
    You're getting old, boy
F#m                 G
    You're getting old, boy
D                   E  
    You're getting old, boy
F#m                 G
    You're getting old, boy
