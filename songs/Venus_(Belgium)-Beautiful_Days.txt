[Intro]
Fmaj7  Am  B7  Esus4 E
Fmaj7  Am  B7  Esus4 E
Am  Fmaj7  Dm  Esus4 E


[Verse 1]
             Am
I wish I was mad
              Fmaj7
Fucked up and done
             Dm
I wish I was bad
               Esus4 E
And completely wrong

             Am
I wish I was made
               Fmaj7
Rebuilt-up and fake
               Dm
I wish I could lie
                Esus4 E
And never could fail


[Chorus]
                        Fmaj7
And live some beautiful days
             Am
In a magical place
          B7
Beautiful loves
            Esus4  E
Perfect and straight

          Fmaj7
Beautiful days
             Am
In a magical place
               B7
A new dream is born
                    Esus4  E
The new freaks have come


[Instrumental]
Am  Fmaj7  Dm  Esus4 E


[Verse 2]
             Am
I wish I was fast
               Fmaj7
And crazy as a dog
               Dm
I wish I could last
               Esus4 E
As long as the gods

               Am
I wish I could be
          Fmaj7
Perfectly free
             Dm
Wish I was a creep
                Esus4 E
Wish I made you bleed


[Chorus]
                        Fmaj7
And live some beautiful days
             Am
In a magical place
          B7
Beautiful loves
            Esus4 E
Perfect and straight

          Fmaj7
Beautiful days
             Am
In a magical place
               B7
A new dream is born
                    Esus4 E
The new freaks have come


          Fmaj7
Beautiful days
             Am
In a magical place
          B7
Beautiful loves
            Esus4 E
Perfect and straight

[Chorus]
                        Fmaj7
And live some beautiful days
             Am
In a magical place
          B7
Beautiful loves
            Esus4 E
Perfect and straight

          Fmaj7
Beautiful days
             Am
In a magical place
