Capo 4
Standard tuning

[Intro]
Em7    D    Em7    D

[Verse 1]
Em7
You must understand though the touch of your hand
           D
Makes my pulse react
          Em7
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
       D
Opposites attract
     C    D          C   D
It's physical, only logical
          C                     D
You must try to ignore that it means more than that

[Chorus]
G       D          C          D
What's love got to do, got to do with it
G       D           C          D
What's love but a second hand emotion
G       D           C           D
What's love got to do, got to do with it
G            D             C            D
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

[Verse 2]
Em7
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
           D
When you're close to me
     Em7
If I tend to look dazed I've read it some place
         D
I've got cause to be
           C       D
There's a name for it
           C           D
There's a phrase that fits
        C                   D
But whatever the reason you do it for me

[Chorus]
G      D          C          D
What's love got to do, got to do with it
G      D           C          D
What's love but a second hand emotion
G       D           C           D
What's love got to do, got to do with it
G            D             C            D
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

[Break]

[Bridge]
G                     A
I've been taking on a new direction
G              A
But I have to say,
F                           G
I've been thinking about my own protection
    Em7                           A
It scares me to feel this way

[Chorus]
A        E          D          E
What's love got to do, got to do with it
A        E          D          E
What's love but a second hand emotion
A        E          D          E
What's love got to do, got to do with it
A              E          D                  E
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

A        E          D          E
What's love got to do, got to do with it
A        E        D                   E
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion
A        E          D          E
What's love got to do, got to do with it
A              E          D             E
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

A        E         D        E
What's love,       (oooh,     got to do with it)
A        E        D            E
What's love but a second hand emotion
A        E          D          E
What's love got to do, got to do with it
A              E          D             E
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
