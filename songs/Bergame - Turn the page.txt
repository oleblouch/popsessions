Jimmy was ill, he just stood still
to breathe and clean his mind up
the souvenir is way too far
but remains as a scar

Clouds were low, air was cold,
night is falling, it doesn’t help (for sure)
« love is not all around you »
that’s how he felt

ref : Em D		ou Dm   C
ref.: all is gone

A bookshop turned its light on,
« It’s been so long » Jimmy sighed
I have not been reading anything else
than  « the far side »

The shop was pretty, intimate and warm,
Jimmy pushed the door
Dazzled by the glow, he almost fell
on the guest author

ref.: all is gone

« How to turn the page » was the title
The writer laid her eyes on him
Her book was a part of a cycle
as the first volume
