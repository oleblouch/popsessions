[Intro]
Adim7  A  A9  Dmaj7  E7  Bm7  Amaj7  Dmaj7
Adim7  A  A9  Dmaj7  E7  Bm7  Amaj7  Dmaj7  Bdm7  E/A

[Verse 1]
E/A A                 A/D
We  took your daddy's car
    D               D/E
And drove it to the sea
   E                 E/A
We fooled around for hours
    A                A/D              D
And then when we got tired and it got dark
   C#7              F#m
We found a place to park
       Esus4       E       Asus4  A
And we watched the sun set fire
       Dsus4  D
To the sea

[Chorus]
Adim7    A                A9     Dmaj7
Can you feel the sadness in our love?
E7       Bm7             A      Dmaj7
It's the only kind we're worthy of
Adim7    A/E             A9     Dmaj7
Can you feel the madness in our hearts
E7     Bm7               Amaj7  Dmaj7
As the key turns and the engine starts?
Bdim   E/A
Engine starts

[Verse 2]
   A                 A/D
We took your daddy's car
    D             D/E
And drove it into town
   E              E/A
We steamed into a bar
       A                  A/D           D
And we bought the biggest bottle of champagne
    C#7                 F#m
And driving through the rain
              Esus4      E        Asus4   A       Dsus4  D
We sang: "God bless this car, and all who sail in her!"

[Chorus]
Adim7   A                A9     Dmaj7
Can you feel the sadness in our love?
E7       Bm7             A      Dmaj7
It's the only kind we're worthy of
Adim7   A/E              A9     Dmaj7
Can you feel the madness in our hearts 
E7     Bm7               Amaj7  Dmaj7
As the key turns and the engine starts?
Bdim7   E/A
Engine starts

[Verse 3]
   A                 A/D
We took your daddy's car
    D                  D/E
And wrapped it round a tree
   E                E/A
We didn't know what for
   A                A/D         D
We didn't feel like driving any more
       C#7
It was so good
       F#m
We got bored
           Esus4   E        Asus4 A    C  C/B C/A C/B Dsus4 D
And we are driving from the day we are born

[Chorus]
Adim7   A                A9     Dmaj7
Can you feel the sadness in our love?
E7       Bm7             A      Dmaj7
It's the only kind we're worthy of
Adim7   A/E              A9     Dmaj7
Can you feel the madness in our hearts
E7     Bm7               Amaj7  Dmaj7
As the key turns and the engine starts?

[Outro]
Adim7   A/E    A9   Dmaj7  E7  Bm7  Amaj7  Dmaj7  Adim7
Can you feel
   A/E   A9 Dmaj7 E7  Bm7  Amaj7 Dmaj7
The engine start?
Dmaj7
Engine start.
