[Intro] 
Synth chords G#m  E  F#  (high-hat starts the drums) 
             C#m  F#  G#m  G#m

[Verse 1]
C#m                        F#
What’s the matter with the way we look
G#m                 G#m
Surely it's not the end
C#m             F#              G#m    G#m
I only meant to make my motions clear
C#m                        F# 
You worry too much if it's understood
G#m                  G#m
Should we be seen as friends?
C#m                    Edim7         E    F#
Seems like a real good beginning right here

[Chorus]
                          B   G#m
'Cause when your heart is weak
F#                      B   G#m
I'm gonna pick the lock on it
F#                  B   G#m
My fingertips won't fail me
F#                 B   G#m
No matter what you do
F#                  B   G#m
The love you cannot see yet
F#                    B      G#m
Is about to witness a dawning
F#                    B G#m
And you can twist and turn
F#                B  G#m     F#
But you won't get loose     Oh no

[Verse 2]
C#m                   F#
Better forget getting rid of me
G#m                 G#m 
I don't see how you can
C#m                      F#                G#m    G#m
You put me off and I will hunt you down...again
C#m                       F#
I'm mighty patient when I have to be
G#m                G#m
You have given me that
C#m                         Edim7          E     F#
Still I look forward to the day you let me in

[Chorus]
                          B   G#m
'Cause when your heart is weak
F#                      B   G#m
I'm gonna pick the lock on it
F#                  B   G#m
My fingertips won't fail me
F#                 B  G#m
No matter what you do
F#  
Oh no matter what you do

[Bridge]
E
I'm gonna prove myself worthy
E                    B
No more just hanging on
          B
Without a prayer of a chance
E
I'm gonna come without warning
E                      F# 
when your defenses are down and you're in
  G#m
a desperate need
      E                             F#
Oh, I bet you then, you'll welcome me...
         
B(stays on B for a long time)
Your ol' companion
B
Your ol' companion
B
Remember baby,

[Chorus]
B                        B   G#m
'Cause when your heart is weak
B                        B   G#m
I'm gonna pick the the lock on it       
B                    B   G#m
My fingertips won't fail me
B               B   G#m
No matter what you do
B             (get ready to go back to F#, subtly)
Yeah ay ay yeah
F#                 B
Yeah               Mmmm
F#                 B
Mmmm               Mmmm
F#                 B
Mm Hmm          Oh Ye-yes

[Chorus]
F#                          B  G#m
'Cause when your heart is weak
F#                      B    G#m
I'm gonna pick the lock on it
F#                    B   G#m
And you can twist and turn
F#                    B      G#m
But you won't get,    you won't get
                F#         B  G#m
No you won't get loose Oh no
