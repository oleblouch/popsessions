[Verse]

G                         Bm
    Ziggy played guitar,    jamming good
               C                         D
with Wierd and Gilly and the Spiders from Mars.

                  G                     Em
He played it left hand, but made it too far
              Am                     C
became the special man, and we were Ziggy's band.

G                            Bm
     Ziggy really sang, with screwed up eyes and
              C                         D
screwed down hairdo like some cat from Japan.

                      G                             Em
He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang.
               Am                                   C
He came on so loaded man, well hung and snow-white tan.


[Chorus]

Am       G                  F  F* F  F* F  F* F    G
     But where were the spiders, 
Am             G            F  F* F  F* F  F* F     G
     while the fly tried to break our balls.
Am             G            F  F* F  F* F  F* F
     Just the beer light to guide us.

          D                                    E
And so we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands.

[Verse]

G                          Bm
    Ziggy played for time, jiving us that
        C                            D
we were voodoo and the kids was just crass.
           G                   Em
He was the nazz with God-given ass.
           Am                                 C
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar.


[Chorus]

Am         G              F  F* F  F* F  F* F   G
    Making love with his ego,
Am         G          F  F* F  F* F  F* F   G
    Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Am         G          F  F* F  F* F  F* F   G
    Like a leper messiah.

         D                                E
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

NOTES: on D* and F*
   D* is used in the [power] section.  I play a normal D and used my 'pinky'
   on the 3rd fret on alternate strums to acheive the (D D* D D* etc) sound on 
   the record. I think D* is actually Dsus but I'm not sure.

   F* is used in the chorus. I pay the F chord as a barre chord (see tab above)
   and lift my first (barre) finger on alternate strums.

   I guess you really have to listen to the record to get the [Chorus] and
   [Power] sections timed/played correctly.
