[Verse]

G                         Bm
    Ziggy played guitar,    jamming good
               C                         D
with Wierd and Gilly and the Spiders from Mars.

                  G                     Em
He played it left hand, but made it too far
              Am                     C
became the special man, and we were Ziggy's band.

G                            Bm
     Ziggy really sang, with screwed up eyes and
              C                         D
screwed down hairdo like some cat from Japan.

                      G                             Em
He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang.
               Am                                   C
He came on so loaded man, well hung and snow-white tan.


[Chorus]

Am       G                  F  F* F  F* F  F* F    G
     But where were the spiders, 
Am             G            F  F* F  F* F  F* F     G
     while the fly tried to break our balls.
Am             G            F  F* F  F* F  F* F
     Just the beer light to guide us.

          D                                    E
And so we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands.

[Verse]

G                          Bm
    Ziggy played for time, jiving us that
        C                            D
we were voodoo and the kids was just crass.
           G                   Em
He was the nazz with God-given ass.
           Am                                 C
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar.


[Chorus]

Am         G              F  F* F  F* F  F* F   G
    Making love with his ego,
Am         G          F  F* F  F* F  F* F   G
    Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Am         G          F  F* F  F* F  F* F   G
    Like a leper messiah.

         D                                E
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.
