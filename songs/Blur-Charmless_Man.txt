[Verse 1]

A              A/G#  F#
I met him in a crowded room
             A            A/G#     F#
Where people go to drink away their gloom
Bm7                C#m7 D        A          D         A
He sat me down and so began, the story of a charmless man
A            A/G#  F#                 A               A/G#  F#
Educated the expensive way, he knows his claret from his beaujolais
             Bm7                C#m7 D   E 
I think he's like to have been Ronnie Kray
           A            D             A
But then nature didn't make him that way
A        A/G#      F#
Na na na na na na na
A        A/G#      F#
Na na na na na na na


[Chorus]

 A
He thinks he's educated, airs those family shares
C#m7   Bm7            C#m7    Bm7
Will protect him that we will respect him
 A
He moves in circles of friends
                      C#m7    Bm7
Who just pretend that they like him

   C#m7   Bm7                          Esus4
He does the same to them, And when you put it all together
            D9                    A
There's the model of a charmless man

[Interlude]
A        A/G#      F#
Na na na na na na na
A        A/G#      F#
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 2]

             A            A/G#      F#
He knows the swingers and their calvarly
             A        A/G#         F#
Says he can get in anywhere for free
Bm7        C#m7  D          E       
I began to go a little cross eyed
A                                  D       A
And from this charmless man I just had to hide


[Chorus]

              A                
He talks at speeds he gets nosebleeds
                   C#m7
He doesn't see his days
Bm7             C#m7  Bm7
Are tumbling down upon him
              A
And yet he tries so hard to please
                      C#m7    Bm7
He's just so keen for you to listen
      C#m7          Bm7
But no one is listening
             Esus4
And when you put it all together
             D9            A
There's the model of a charmless man

[Solo]
A        A/G#      F#
A        A/G#      F#
Bm7  C#m7  D  E 
A   D  A


[Chorus]

 A
He thinks he's educated, airs those family shares
C#m7   Bm7            C#m7    Bm7
Will protect him that we will respect him
                      C#m7    Bm7
He's just so keen for you to listen
      C#m7          Bm7
But no one is listening
             Esus4
And when you put it all together
             D9            A
There's the model of a charmless man
