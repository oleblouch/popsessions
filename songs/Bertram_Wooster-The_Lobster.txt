The lobster

A		A/B
I live under the sea, look at me
A/D		A/C#
Got time and water
A/B				A
I'm such a quiet lobster

A
Don't skim pebble stones
A/B
Vibrations that you cause
A/D			   A/C#
Disturb my peaceful, aquatic heartbeat
A/B			A/E ou E	E7/D
I chose my life not to suffer from you

Refrain

F#m7
My shellâ€™s stronger than a shield
	Dmaj7
And I can pinch
All humans in the world

Living on my own....playing with my claws...makes me so happy, can't you see
That I won't share it with anybody

Refrains
