[Verse 1]

Gm9            Bb             Am7
She sits alone waiting for suggestions
Gm9               Bb              Am7
He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions
Gm9                   Bb              Am7
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Gm9                  Bb                  Am7
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?


[Chorus]

Dm
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
F
Come on sugar, let me know
Dm
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
F
Come on honey, tell me so, tell me so baby

Dm       F
Dm  Dm7  F


[Verse 2]

Gm9             Bb             Am7
He's acting shy looking for an answer
Gm9                     Bb                Am7
   Come on honey, let's spend the night together
    Gm9                Bb              Am7
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Gm9               Bb             Am7
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
Gm9                        Bb         Am7
   They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
   Gm9                   Bb              Am7
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant


[Chorus]

Dm
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
F
Come on honey, tell me so
Dm
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me

Come on sugar, let me know

[Bridge]

    Am7                    Dm
His heart's beating like a drum
          Am7                     Dm
'cause at last he's got this girl home
Gm          Bbm            C
Relax baby, now we're all alone

[Verse 3]

Gm9                      Bb                C7
They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Gm9                     Bb                      C7
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Gm9                Bb             C7
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
Gm9                  Bb               C7
They got each other, neither one's complaining
Gm9                         Bb              C7
He says, "I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee"
Gm9                      Bb              C7
Never mind sugar, we can watch the early movie


[Chorus]

Dm
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy

Come on sugar, let me know
Dm
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me

Come on honey, tell me so

Dm   Dm7   F
Sugar

(Continue this chord pattern over the rest of the lyrics until fadeout)

If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know
If you really, really, really, really need me
Just let me know
Just reach out and touch me

If you really want me
Just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know

If you really need me j-j-just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know
If you, if you, if you really need me
Just come on and tell me so
Just reach out and tell me so
