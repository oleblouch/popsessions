Harry was a rich young man who would become a priest
G                                 C            G
He dug up his dear father who was recently deceased
A              C     G           A          C       G
He did it with tarot cards and a mystically attuned mind
A           C         G            D
And shortly there and after he did find

G                                    C                    G
Jeanny was a spoiled young brat, she thought she knew it all
G                                         C              G
She smoked mentholated cigarettes and she had sex in the hall
     A      C      G       A     C     G
But she was not my kind or even of my sign
A           C    G                 D
The kind of animal that I would be about

[Chorus]
D         G
Oh oh oh, you keep hangin' 'round me
C
And I'm not so glad you found me
G                                        D
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
D         G
Oh oh oh, you keep hangin' 'round me
C
And I'm not so glad you found me
G                                        D
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
G               G
Hangin' 'round, hangin' 'round

Cathy was a bit surreal, she painted all her toes
G                                  C                     G
And on her face she wore dentures clamped tightly to her nose
A            C        G          A        C       G
And when she finally spoke her twang her glasses broke
A           C         G                           D
And no one else could smoke while she was in the room

G                                C                G
Hark the herald angels sang and reached out for a phone
G                                 C                   G
And plucking it with ivory hand dialed long distance home
A           C       G      A        C     G
But it was all too much sprinkling angel dust
A           C         G                  D
to A.T. and T. Who didn't wish you well

[Chorus]
D         G
Oh oh oh, you keep hangin' 'round me
C
And I'm not so glad you found me
G                                        D
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
D         G
Oh oh oh, you keep hangin' 'round me
C
And I'm not so glad you found me
G                                        D
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
G               G
Hangin' 'round, hangin' 'round

G               G
Hangin' 'round, hangin' 'round
G               G
Hangin' 'round, hangin' 'round
G               G
Hangin' 'round, hangin' 'round
