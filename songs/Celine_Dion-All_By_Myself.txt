[Verse]

 A                       Dm6       A
When I was young I never needed anyone
Em7        F#sus  F#       Bm
And makin' love was just for fun
Dm
Those days are gone

A Dm E

A                        Dm6                A
Livin' alone I think of all the friends I've known
Em7    F#sus F#    Bm
When I dial the telephone
Dm            A
nodody's home

G F# E D# D D C#
Em F#sus F#7 B Dm E7 A


[Chorus]

A        C#m
All by my self Don't wanna be
Em F#sus F# Bm
All  by  my self
   E
Anymore


[Verse]

 A
Hard to be sure
            Dm6         A
Sometimes I feel so insecure
Em7           F#sus    F#  Bm
And love's so distant and obscure
Dm                A
remains the cure

G F# E D# D D C#
Em F#sus F#7 B Dm E7 A


[Chorus]

All by my self Don't wanna be
Em  F#sus F#  Bm        E
All  by   my  self   Anymore
