[Verse 1]

       C
I have climbed highest mountains

I have run through the fields
        Fsus2                C
only to be with you, only to be with you
       C
I have run, I have crawled
                                           Fsus2
I have scaled these city walls, these city walls
        C
only to be with you


[Chorus 1]

      G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
      G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for


[Verse 2]

       C
I have kissed honey lips

Felt the healing in her fingertips
               Fsus2                C
It burned like fire, this burning desire
       C
I have spoke with the tongue of angels

I have held the hand of the devil
                   Fsus2                  C
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone


[Chorus 2]

      G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
      G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

[Verse 3]

    C
I believe in the kingdom come

then all the colours they will
                           Fsus2
bleed into one, bleed into one
                  C
But yes I'm still running
              C
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
                                         Fsus2
carried the cross of, of my shame, of my shame
             C
You know I believe it


[Chorus 3]

      G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
      G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
      G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
      G             Fsus2          C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
