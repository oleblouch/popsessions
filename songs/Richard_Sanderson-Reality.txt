[Verse]

G                    Bm
Met you by surprise, I didn't realize
Dm                           E             (D E)
That my life would change forever
Am                      Cm
Saw you standing there, I didn't know I cared
Bm7                  Em7            A7  D7
There was something special in the air.


[Chorus]

G                  B7
Dreams are my reality
                       Em7   A7
The only kind of real fantasy
          C            D7
Illusions are a common thing
  Bm7              Em7
I try to live in dreams
Am7                          Fmaj D7
It seems as if it's meant to be.
G                  B7
Dreams are my reality
                    Em7      A7
A different kind of reality
           C            D7
I dream of loving in the night
    Bm7              Em7
And loving seems alright
Am7                 D7    C G
Although it's only fantasy.

G                Bm
If you do exist, honey don't resist
Dm                   E     (D E)
Show me a new way of loving
Am                      Cm
Tell me that it's true, show me what to do
Bm7               Em7            A7  D7
I feel something special about you.


[Chorus]
G                  B7

                 Em7     A7
The only kind of reality
          C            D7
Maybe my foolishness has past
    Bm7              Em7
And maybe now at last
Am7                 Fmaj      D7
I'll see how a real thing can be.
G                  B7
Dreams are my reality
                   Em7            A7
A wondrous world where I like to be
           C               D7
I dream of holding you all night
    Bm7                Em7
And holding you seems right
Am7                 D7   C G
Perhaps that's my reality.
