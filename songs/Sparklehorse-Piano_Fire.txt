I got sunburnt waiting for the jets to land
Em       D                       Am7         Cmaj7
Circus people with hairy little hands

Squeeky old organs have given up the ghost
Em      D            Am7             Cmaj7
Fry them up and cure the piano birds
Em                     D                      Am7         Cmaj7
There's creeky old organs burning on the coast

I can't seem to breathe, with a rusted metal heart

I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes
