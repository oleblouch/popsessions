[Verse]

F         C      Gm            A 
She’s been dancing in a topless bar 
Dm            C       F 
And she doing well so far 
F     C          Gm               A 
She is working to earn her own dollar
Dm               C              Gm           A     
‘Coz the fortune teller didn’t talk about stars 

[Chorus]

Dm      C               F
She has black and white eyes 
Bb             A
A mind full of vintage squibs 
Dm      C               F
She has black and white eyes 
Bb             A
A mind full of cheering lives 

[Verse]

F         C 
She needs something 
   Gm                    A
To keep her feet on the ground 
Dm                       C
‘Coz when she’s flying around 
          Gm                  A
She never wants to come back down 

[Bridge]

F       C        Gm     A    
She lost her smile in ’95
Dm              C                Gm                A 
When she woke up on the back seat of a stunted car 

[Chorus]

Dm      C               F
She has black and white eyes 
Bb             A
A mind full of vintage squibs 
Dm      C               F
She has black and white eyes 
Bb             A
A mind full of cheering lives 

[Bridge]

F       C       Gm    A
'think I lost her at 24
Dm               C                   Gm                    A 
When she started to lock herself up behind the bathroom door 

[Chorus 2]

Dm      C            F
All along the white line 
Bb             A  
She can travel back in time 
Dm      C            F
All along the white line 
Bb             A  
...

[Chorus 2]

Dm      C            F
All along the white line 
        Bb             A  
She can travel back in time 
Dm      C            F
All along the white line 
        Bb             A  
...

[Verse 4]

F         C      Gm            A 
I’m on my way looking up today 
Dm               C              
Never mind if it could be worth it 
Gm           A     
Tuesday flies away
