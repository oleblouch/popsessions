[Verse 1]

Am    Am/F#  Em  G/F# G         Am
   Karma police,   arrest this man
    F/C       Em  G/F#    G               Am
He talks in maths,    he buzzes like a fridge
      D      G       C   C/B  Am   Bm   D
He's like a detuned ra - di - o

Am    Am/F#  Em  G/F# G         Am
   Karma police,   arrest this girl
     F/C    Em    G/F#  G             Am
Her Hitler hairdo   is making me feel ill
    D         G          C    C/B  Am   Bm   D
And we have crashed her par - ty - y

  This is what you get, when you mess with us


[Verse 2]

Am     Am/F# Em  G/F#  G           Am
   Karma police, I've given all I can,
      F/C   Em  G/F#   G           Am
it's not enough. I've given all I can,
      D         G       C    C/B  Am   Bm   D
but we're still on the pay - ro - oll


[Chorus]

C           Dadd4   G/D   F#/C#
  This is what you get
C           Dadd4   G/D   F#/C#
  This is what you get
C           Dadd4   G/D           Bm       C    Bm   D
  This is what you get, when you mess with us

For a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself
Bm          D      G   G/E D     G    G/E D     E7
And for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself

Bm            D      G   G/E D     G    G/E D     E7
Phew, for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myse - lf
