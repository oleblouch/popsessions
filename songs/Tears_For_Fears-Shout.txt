[Chorus]
Em                            Cmaj7/G
Shout, Shout, let it all out. These are the things I can do without
     Asus2                        Em
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on
Em                            Cmaj7/G
Shout, Shout, let it all out. These are the things I can do without
     Asus2                        Em
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on

[Verse]
     G                                   Asus2
In violent times, you shouldn't have to sell your soul
    G                                    Asus2
In black and white, they really really ought to know
       G                                 Asus2
Those one track minds that took you for a working boy
        G                                Asus2
Kiss them goodbye, you shouldn't have to jump for joy (You shouldn't have to...)

[Chorus]
Em                            Cmaj7/G

Come on, I'm talking to you, come on

[Verse]
      G                                  Asus2
They gave you life and in return you gave them them hell
    G                                    Asus2
As cold as ice, I hope we live to tell the tale (I hope we live to...)

[Chorus]
