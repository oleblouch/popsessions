[Verse 1]
                            Am    Em G Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                          Am    Em G Am
It's not warm when she's away
                              Em                             Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and she's always gone too long
                  Am    Em G Am
Anytime she goes away

                       Am        Em G Am
Wonder this time where she's gone
                     Am      Em G Am
Wonder if she's gone to stay
                              Em                                Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home
                  Am    Em G Am
Anytime she goes away

N.C.
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
N.C.
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
N.C.
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
N.C.
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
N.C.
Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone

[Verse 2]
                                Am    Em G Am
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                            Am    Em G Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                    Am    Em G Am
Only darkness every day
                              Em                                Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home
                  Am    Em G Am
Anytime she goes away
                  Am    Em G Am
Anytime she goes away
                  Am    Em G Am
Anytime she goes away
                  Am    Em G Am
Anytime she goes away
