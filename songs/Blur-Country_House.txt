[Verse 1]

A                E
City dweller, successful fella
Bm                                              D
Thought to himself, "Oops, I've got a lot of money" (lot of money)
            D/C#             C#
Caught in a rat race terminally

         A                      E
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
    Bm                                                   D
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit (to the limit)
                 D/C#           C#
Caught up in the century's anxiety
        E
Yes, it preys on him (preys on him)
     E
He's getting thin (getting thin) {Try a simple life}


[Chorus 1]

A                                            E7       E D#
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
         D                                             A
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
             A                                                 E7      E D#
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
                 D                                       A
Oh, it's like an animal farm, lots of rural charm in the country


[Verse 2]

         A                  E7
He's got morning glory and life's a different story
Bm                                 D
Everything's going Jackanory (Jackanory)
                 D/C#      C#
Touched with his own mortality
     A                  E
He's reading Balzac and knocking back Prozac
       Bm                                            D
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
             D/C#          C#
Oh, it's the century's remedy
        E
For the faint at heart
  E
A new start (new start) {Try a simple life}


[Chorus 2]

A                                            E7       E D#
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
           D                                                  A
He's got a fog in his chest, so he needs a lot of rest in the country
           A                                              E7       E D#
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh, takes herbal baths in the country
                   D                                  A
But you'll come to no harm on the animal farm in the country
E
In the country (Doo doo doo)
E
In the country (Doo doo doo)
E
In the country-y-y!

A             E           D                A
Blow, blow me out I am so sad I don't know why
A             E           D                A
Blow, blow me out I am so sad I don't know why

       A                                         E7       E D#
Oh, he lives in a house, a very big house in the country
           D                                                  A
He's got a fog in his chest, so he needs a lot of rest in the country
           A                                              E7       E D#
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh, takes herbal baths in the country
                      D                              A
Yes you'll come to no harm on the animal farm in the country

Ooh la la la
