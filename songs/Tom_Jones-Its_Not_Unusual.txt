[Verse 1]
C                       Dm             G
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
C                        Dm             Dm
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
Em                           Dm
but when I see you hanging a bout with anyone
G                   C                Dm    G
It's not unusual to see me cry and I wanna die

[Verse 2]
C                      Dm             G
It's not unusual to go out at any time
C                           Dm                   Dm
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
Em                            Dm
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
G                    C
It's not unusual, it happens every day

[Bridge]
   Dm
No matter what you say
G                              C   Dm G
You'll find it happens all the time
C                  Dm
Love will never do what you want it to
G              G7            Em Ebm Dm G 
Why can't this crazy love be mine

It's not unusual to be mad with anyone

It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
Em                             Dm                  Dm
but if I ever find that you've changed at any time
G                     C              Dm
It's not unusual to  find out I'm in love with you
Em    Dm                   G    C  Em Ebm Dm  G
whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa
