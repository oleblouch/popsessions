[Intro]
D   G   D (x4)

[Verse 1]
                                   D   G   D
Darling, you've got to let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go
                                   G   F   G
If you say that you are mine
                                   D   G   D
I'll be here 'til the end of time
                                   A
So you've got to let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go


[Verse 2]
                                   D   G   D
It's always tease, tease, tease
                                   D   G   D
You're happy when I'm on my knees
                                   G   F   G
One day is fine, the next is black
                                   D   G   D
So if you want me off your back
                                   A
Well, come on and let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go?


[Chorus]
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   G   F   G
If I go there will be trouble
                                   D   G   D
And if I stay it will be double
                       A             D G   D
So come on and let me know


[Verse 3]
                                   D   G   D
This indecision's bugging me
                                   D   G   D
If you don't want me set me free
                                   G   F   G
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be
                                   D   G   D
Don't you know which clothes even fit me
                                   A
Come on and let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I cool it or should I blow?

Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   G   F   G
If I go there will be trouble
                                   D   G   D
And if I stay it will be double
                                   A
So you got to let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I cool it or should I blow

                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   G   F   G
If I go there will be trouble
                                   D   G   D
And if I stay it will be double
                                   A
So you got to let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I cool it or should I go
