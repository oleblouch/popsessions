[Verse 1]
                                   D   G   D
Darling, you've got to let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go
                                   G   F   G
If you say that you are mine
                                   D   G   D
I'll be here 'til the end of time
                                   A
So you've got to let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go


[Verse 2]

It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day is fine, the next is black
So if you want me off your back
Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?


[Chorus]
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   G   F   G
If I go there will be trouble
                                   D   G   D
And if I stay it will be double
                       A             D G   D
So come on and let me know


[Verse 3]

This indecision's bugging me
If you don't want me set me free
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be
Don't you know which clothes even fit me
Come on and let me know
Should I cool it or should I blow?


(Instrumental)


[Chorus]
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   G   F   G
If I go there will be trouble
                                   D   G   D
And if I stay it will be double

The chorus has the same chords as the verse but is faster and the rhythm is 
different. This is a pretty simple song to play, just listen to the song to pick up 
the strumming pattern.
