[Verse 1]

Bm            F#m          Em
You and me we used to be together
A           F#m      Em    A
Every day together, always
  Bm       F#m         Em         A
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
  F#m                 Bm       Em     A
I can't believe this could be the end
   Bm         F#m    Em           A
It looks as though you're letting go
    D                  A               B
And if it's real, well I don't want to know


[Chorus]

Em
Don't speak,
  Am                    D
I know just what you're saying
B                Am
So please stop explaining
      B                 Em      Am  B
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Em
Don't speak,
Am                  D
I know what you're thinking
B                  Am
I don't need your reasons,
      B                 Em      Am  D
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts


[Verse 2]

    Bm       F#m           Em
Our memories they can be inviting
             A          F#m      Em        A
But some are altogether mighty frightening
 Bm   F#m   Em          A
As we die, both you and I
D                     A              B
  With my head in my hands I sit and cry


[Chorus]

Em
Don't speak,
  Am                    D
I know just what you're saying
B                Am
So please stop explaining
      B                 Em       Am  B
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts, nononono

Em
Don't speak,
Am                  D
I know what you're thinking
    B                  Am
And I don't need your reasons,
      B                  E5  D5  B5  G5
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts


[Bridge]

C        G/B
It's all ending
        Bb      F/A            Ab5 A5 D5    A5 D5 G5
I gotta stop pretending who we are...


[Solo]

Bm   F#m   Em   A   x3
F#m  Bm    Em


Bm        F#m  Em           A          Em  A
You and me,    I can see us dying... are we?


[Chorus]

Em
Don't speak
  Am                    D

So please stop explaining

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
      Am       B        Em
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts!

Am                 D
I know what you're saying
B                Am
So please stop explaining
B
Don't speak,
Em
don't speak,
Am     B
don't speak

Em  Am                  D
Oh, I know what you're thinking
    B                  Am
And I don't need your reasons
B
I know you're good,
Em
I know you're good,
       Am      B          Em
I know you're real good, oh

Am   D    B   Am
Lalalala, lalalala,
B    Em     Am    B
Don’t, don’t, ooh ooh

Hush, hush darling
D            B
