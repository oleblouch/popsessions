[Intro]
G Cadd9 Am7 C   D G


[Verse 1]
G          Cadd9
Saying I love you is
Am7             C       D         G
not the words I want to hear from you
G                Cadd9
It's not that I want you
Am7            C      D    Em
not to say but if you only knew
         Am7
Ho-ow ea-sy
D              G      D/F#     Em
It would be to show me how you feel
          Am7      D7              G7
More than words is all you have to do
G7         C
To make it real
C         Cm              G
Then you wouldn't have to say
          Em7
That you love me 'cos
Am7    D7   G
I'd already know


[Chorus]
G              D/F#   Em          Bm      C
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
C                    G/B    Am7            D7              G
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
G              D/F#     Em7        Bm     C
What would you say if I took those words away?
C                     G/B      Am7
Then you couldn't make things new
         D7           G
Just by saying I love you

[Verse 2]
G             Cadd9
Now that I've tried to 
Am7             C        D     G
Talk to you and make you understand
G            Cadd9
All that you have to do is
Am7            C               D          Em
Close your eyes and just reach out your hands
          Am7
And touch me
D                   G    D/F#   Em
Hold me close don't ever let me go
          Am7
More than words
D7           G7                 C
Is all I ever needed you to show
C        Cm                   G
Then you wouldn't have to say
          Em7
That you love me 'cos
Am7   D7    G
I'd already know


[Chorus]
G              D/F#     Em        Bm      C
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
C                   G/B     Am7             D7                G
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
G              D/F#     Em7        Bm     C
What would you say if I took those words away?
C                     G/B      Am7
Then you couldn't make things new
        D7            G
Just by saying I love you
