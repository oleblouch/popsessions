[Verse 1]

  E 
I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
  E                             B
I knew he musta been about seventeen
    A                B
The beat was going strong
E                   A
Playin' my favorite song

An' I could tell it wouldn't be long

Till he was with me, yeah me
N.C.
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
                 B
Till he was with me, yeah me, singin'


[Chorus]

E
I love rock n' roll
   A                       B
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
E
I love rock n' roll
   A                           B          E

E                                               B
That don't matter, he said, 'Cause it's all the same
A                   B
Said can I take you home
      E          A
