Here's my version of "It's Probably Me" by: Sting (for acoustic guitar).  
I arranged this song different from the other versions by simplifying
some of the chords, and using a few chord substitutions when possible.
Sting wrote this tune with Eric Clapton, so it tends to sound different
from your standard tune (eerie yet quite beautiful); If you practice the
chord changes it works quite well (try not to let the chord names scare
you off; it's honestly not as difficult as it may seem at first glance).
As always, feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns:

Sting - It's Probably Me 


[Intro] 
Emmaj9  Em6add9   Em9       Em6add9 x2


[Verse 1]
               Emmaj9                    Em6add9
If the night turned cold - and the stars looked down
           Em9                    Em6add9
And you hug yourself - on the cold cold ground
        Am7                             Bm7
You wake the morning - in a stranger's coat
                  Em      G6       Em
No one would you see


[Chorus]
            Am7                     Bm7
You ask yourself - who'd watch for me
        Em                    Em/C#
My only friend - who could it be
                 C - Cadd9        B7     
It's hard to say it - I hate to say it 
              Emmaj9 - Em6add9 - Em9     - Em6add9
it's probably me


[Verse 2]
               Emmaj9                    Em6add9
When you belly's empty - and the hunger's so real
           Em9                           Em6add9
You're too proud to beg - and too dumb to steal
        Am7                         Bm7
You search the city - for your only friend 
                Em      G6      Em
No one would you see


[Chorus]
        Am7                       Bm7
You ask yourself, - who could it be
        Em                                   Em/C#
A solitary voice to speak out and set you free
        C        Cadd9       B7               
I hate to say it - I hate to say it, 
              Emmaj9 - Em6add9 - Em9     - Em6add9
it's probably me


[Bridge]
                  Am7                         D - Dsus4 - D
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
         G (bass-walk-down G,F#,E)   Em7     
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
              Am7                          D - Dsus4 - D
Some would say I should let you go your way
                  G
You'll only make me cry


[Chorus]
Am7                       Bm7
If there's one guy - just one guy
     Em                      Em/C#
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
        C        Cadd9       B7                
It's hard to say it - It's hard to say it
              Emmaj9 - Em6add9 - Em9     - Em6add9 
but it's probably me


[Verse 3]
       Emmaj9                            Em6add9
When the world's gone crazy - and it makes no sense
             Em9                           Em6add9
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
                 Am7                 Bm7
When the jury's out and your eyes search the room
                                   Em             G6   Em
And one friendly face is all you need to see


[Chorus]
              Am7             Bm7
If there's one guy - just one guy
     Em                        Em/C#
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
              C   Cadd9       B7         
It's hard to say it  - I hate to say it, 
               Am7    A7
but it's probably me
     C        Cadd9             B7                
I hate to say it - I hate to say it,  
           Emmaj9 - Em6add9 - Em9     - Em6add9  (repeat 2x)
it's probably me
