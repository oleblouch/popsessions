In Between Days - The Cure
---------------------------

[Verse]
A          Dmaj7       A                   D
Yesterday I got so old I felt like I could die
A          D           A                  D
Yesterday I got so old it made me wanna cry

A                D
Go on go on just walk away
   A             D
Go on go on your choice is made
   A            D
Go on go on and disappear
   A         D
Go on go on away from here


[Chorus]
      Bm9                     E
And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
        Bm                        E                      A
That it could've been me and with her in between without you (*)


[Verse]

A          Dmaj7       A                   D
Yesterday I got so scared I shivered like a child
A          D           A                  D
Yesterday away from you it froze me deep inside
A                D
Come back come back don't walk away
A                D
come back come back come back today
A                D
come back come back why can't you see
A                D
come back come back come back to me

      Bm9                     E
And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
        Bm                        E                      A
That it could've been me and with her in between without you (*)

Version 2

In Between Days
==============

[...]
A           D               A               D
Yesterday I got so scared I shivered like a child

It sounds better if all the D's in the entire song are replaced with D
major 7th chords.  The following shows the difference on the guitar.
For those of us with keyboards, a D major 7th is D,F#,A,C#.  Enjoy!!!

D:              D Major 7th:
xxo             xxo
||||||          ||||||
|||@|@          |||@@@
||||@|          ||||||
||||||          ||||||

(Note: I don't remember all the lyrics very well, don't laugh!)

(intro is like verses)


[Verse]
A           D               A               D
Yesterday I got so scared I shivered like a child
A          D               A               D
Yesterday away from you it made me want to cry
   A              D
Go on go on don't walk away
   A             D
Go on go on your choice is made
     A                  D
Come back come back why can't you see
     A                   D
Come back come back come back to me


[Chorus]
      Bm                      E
And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
        Bm                    E
That it couldn't be me and be her in between
        A       D
Without you
        A       D
Without you
