[Intro]
 
C#m          A            F#         C#m
 
[Verse 1]
 
      C#m            C#m9                  A               E         
With hand         on heart             you right from the start         
      A              E           F#
You taught    me to take      my part
    C#m             C#m9                     A         E
No cross         to bare                  no reason to care
   A              E              F#            A
my life   was all up          in air
 
[Chorus]
 
C#m                                                 A
Four to the floor I was sure         never seeing clear
                 F#                                        C#m  
I could have it all                       whenever you are near
 
[Verse 2]
The iron hand did not understand the plight of the common man
 
[Chorus]
 
C#m                                                 A
Four to the floor I was sure         never seeing clear
                 F#                                        C#m  
I could have it all                       whenever you are near
