[Intro]

Am

[Verse 1]

Am
 Baby, can’t you see
Am
 I’m calling
Am
 A guy like you
Am
 Should wear a warning
C
 It’s dangerous
E7            Am
 I’m fallin’

Am
 There’s no escape

 I can’t wait

 I need a hit

 Baby, give me it
C
 You’re dangerous

Am
Too high
Am
Can’t come down
   Am
Losing my head
         Am
Spinning ‘round and ‘round
C E7                   Am
    Do you feel me now


[Chorus]

       Am
With a taste of your lips
    C
I’m on a ride
B7            Bb7
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
       Am                     C
With a taste of a poison paradise
       F7
I’m addicted to you
          E7                     Am   C
Don’t you know that you’re toxic
      B7
And I love what you do

Don’t you know that you’re toxic

[Verse 2]

Am
 It’s getting late
Am
 To give you up
Am
 I took a sip
Am
 From my devil's cup
C
 Slowly
E7                  Am
It’s taking over me


[Pre-Chorus 2]

Am
Too high
Am
Can’t come down
Am
It’s in the air
         Am
And it’s all around
C E7                    Am
    Can you feel me now
