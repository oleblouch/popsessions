[Verse 1]
D       F#m  F                B
  Candy says, I've come to hate my body,
Em              A           D             A
  and all that it requires, in this world.
D       F#m  F               B
  Candy says, I'd like to know completely,
Em             A               D          A
  what other souls discreetly, talk about.

[Chorus]
D          G                    E
 I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly,
A
 over my shoulder.
D          G                    E
 I'm gonna watch them pass me by,
A
maybe when I'm older.
C                      G
 What do you think I'd see,
   A                      C
if I could walk away from me?    (4 beat pause)

[Verse 2]
D       F#m  F            B
  Candy says, I hate the quiet places,
Em                A                 D            A
  that cause the smallest taste, of what will be.
D       F#m  F           B
  Candy says, I hate the big decisions,
Em           A                  D          A
  that cause endless revisions, in my mind.

[Chorus]
D          G                    E
 I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly,
A
 over my shoulder.
D          G                    E
 I'm gonna watch them pass me by,
A
maybe when I'm older.
C                      G
 What do you think I'd see,
   A                      C
if I could walk away from me?    (4 beat pause)

[Outro]
D                   G
..........Doo, Doo, Whaa.........
D                   G
Doo.......Doo, Doo, Whaa......... (x4)

D
Doo...
