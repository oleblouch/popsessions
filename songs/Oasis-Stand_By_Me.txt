[Verse 1]

G                          B7add11
  Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday,
 C         C2/B             D
I've got a lot of things to learn
G                          B7add11
  Said I would and I'll be leaving one day,
  C             C2/B      D
Before my heart starts to burn.


[Bridge 1]

C                            D
  So what's the matter with you?
G         D         Em
  Sing me something new
                   A
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know,
     C                         D
They only seem to come and go away.


[Verse 2]

G                                 B7add11
  Times are hard when things have got no meaning.
 C           C2/B         D
I've found a key upon the floor.
G                      B7add11
  Maybe you and I will not believe in
    C                C2/B     D
The things we find behind the door.


[Bridge 2]

C                            D
  So what's the matter with you?
G         D         Em
  Sing me something new
                   A
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know,
     C                         D
They only seem to come and go away.


[Chorus 1]

G          D            Am
  Stand by me, nobody knows_____
                    C Fmaj7 D7/F#
The way it's gonna be.
G          D            Am

                    C Fmaj7 D7/F#
The way it's gonna be
G          D           Am
  Stand by me, nobody knows_____
              C
Yeah, nobody knows_____
D                     G
  The way it's gonna be


[Verse 3]

G                            B7add11
  If you're leaving will you take me with you?
    C                C2/B  D
I'm tired of talking on my phone.
G                          B7add11
  There is one thing I can never give you,
   C                C2/B    D
My heart will never be your home.


[Bridge 3]

C                            D
  So what's the matter with you?
G         D         Em
  Sing me something new
                   A
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know,
     C                         D
They only seem to come and go away.


[Chorus 2]

G          D            Am
  Stand by me, nobody knows_____
                    C Fmaj7 D7/F#

                    Em   D  Cadd9
The way it's gonna be, yeah.
             Em    D/F#  Cadd9
Maybe I can see, yeah
                   A
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know,
      C                        D
They only seem to come and go away. Hey!
