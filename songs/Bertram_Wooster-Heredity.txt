Thomas Hardy - Heredity

Bb Eb Ebm Bb
Bb Eb Ebm F

                          Bb
I am the family face; 
Ab        Gm         
Flesh perishes, I live on, 
Eb              Cm7 
Projecting trait and trace 
F        Gm
Through time to times anon, 
F      Ebm7
And leaping from place to place 
F	Bb
Over oblivion.

The years-heired feature that can
Bb		Am 
In curve and voice and eye
F		Dm7 
Despise the human span
G		Am
Ofdurance--that is I;
G		Fm7 
The eternal thing in man,
G		C 		transition en A
That heeds no call to die.
