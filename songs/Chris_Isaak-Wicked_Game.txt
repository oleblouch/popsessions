[Intro]
Bm  A  E    x4

[Verse 1]
Bm                        A                        E
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
     Bm                       A                    E
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
Bm                     A                     E
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.
Bm                     A                     E
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.

[Chorus]
    Bm A                     E
No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
    Bm A                     E
No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
      Bm  A  E
With you.
      Bm  A  E
With you.      (This world is only gonna break your heart)

[Verse 2]
Bm             A            E
What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way.
Bm              A         E
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.
Bm              A          E
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way.
Bm              A         E
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you. 

[Chorus]
     Bm A                     E
And, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
    Bm A                     E
No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
      Bm
With you.

[Verse 3]
Bm                         A                       E
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
     Bm                       A                    E
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
Bm                     A                     E
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you.
Bm                     A                     E
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you, no.

No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
      Bm  A  E
With you.      (This world is only gonna break your heart)
      Bm  A  E
With you.      (This world is only gonna break your heart)

   Nobody loves no one.
