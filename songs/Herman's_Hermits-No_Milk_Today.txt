[Verse 1]
Am                C
No milk today, my love has gone away.
    E                Am      E             Am
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn.
                  C
No milk today, it seems a common sight,
    E              Am       E               Am
But people passing by don't know the reason why.

A                        G
How could they know just what this message means,
    D                           E       A
The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams,
                       G
How could they know, a palace there had been,
D                             E          A
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen.

Am                C
No milk today, it wasn't always so,
    E           Am      E                 Am
The company was gay, we turn'd night into day.


[Chorus]
A                E         F#m            E
  But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A            E          D
  A terraced house in a mean street back of town
A           E             F#m          E
  Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
D               E
Just two up two down.


[Verse 2]
Am                C
No milk today, it wasn't always so,
    E           Am       E                 Am
The company was gay, we turn'd night into day.
                     C
As music played the faster did we dance
    E               Am        E            Am
We felt it both at once, the start of our romance.

A                        G
How could they know just what this message means,
    D                           E       A
The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams,
                       G
How could they know, a palace there had been,
D                             E          A
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen.

Am                C
No milk today, my love has gone away.
    E                Am      E             Am
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn.


[Chorus]
A                E         F#m            E
  But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A            E          D
  A terraced house in a mean street back of town
A           E             F#m          E
  Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
D               E
Just two up two down.


[Verse 3]
Am                C
No milk today, my love has gone away.
    E                Am      E             Am
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn.
                  C
No milk today, it seems a common sight,
    E              Am       E               Am
But people passing by don't know the reason why.

A                        G
How could they know just what this message means,
    D                           E       A
The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams,
                       G
How could they know, a palace there had been,
D                             E          A
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen.

Am                C
No milk today, it wasn't always so,
    E           Am      E                 Am
The company was gay, we turn'd night into day.


[Outro]
A                E         F#m            E
  But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A            E          D
  A terraced house in a mean street back of town (Repeat x3 and fade on last repeat)
