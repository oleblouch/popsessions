Eb            Ab                         Bb  Ab 
Where is the moment when we need it the most 
Eb               Ab                      Bb  Ab
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Cm                Bb                   Ab 
They tell me your blue sky's faded to grey
                  Eb             Fm 
The tell me your passion's gone away
                             Bb  Ab  Bb 
And I don't need no carrying on

Stand in the line just to hit a new low
Eb               Ab                      Bb  Ab 
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go 
Cm                Bb                  Ab 
You tell me your life's been way off line 
                   Eb         Fm 
You're falling to pieces everytime 
                             Bb 
And I don't need no carrying on 

[Chorus]
                     Eb
Cause you had a bad day 
                  Ab 
You're taking one down 
               Fm                    Bb
You sing a sad song just to turn it around 
                   Eb 
You say you don't know 
                   Ab
You tell me don't lie
                Fm                    Bb 
You work at a smile and you go for a ride 
               Cm 
You had a bad day
                  Bb
The camera don't lie

                             Bb 
And I don't need no carrying on

[Bridge]
Gm  Gb               
    Sometimes the system goes on the blink
         B
And the whole thing it turns out wrong

You might not make it back and you know 
               B
That you could be well oh that strong 
              Bb   
Well I'm nog wrong

Ab
Oh you and I 
Eb               Ab                      Bb
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost 

[Chorus]
