[Verse 1]
        C
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
        C/E   D#dim7    G/D   G7
But the fire is     so delightful
    Dm7           A7      Dm7
And since we've no place to go
          Dm               G6           C
Let it snow, let it snow,   let it snow
         C
Man it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
      C/E            D#dim7   G/D  G7
And I brought me some corn for poppin'
    Dm7              A7      Dm7
The lights are turned way down low
Dm7 D#dim      Dm7  G7        C    G C
    Let    it snow,    let it snow.

[Chorus 1]
        G                    G#dim
When we finally kiss goodnight
         Am7       D7        G
How I'll hate going out in the storm
                          Bm7  E7
But if you really hold me tight
A7             D7            G7
All the way home   I'll be warm
 
[Verse 2]
        C
And the fire is slowly dying
        C/E        D#dim7    G/D G7
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
       Dm7        A7     Dm7
But as long as you love me so
          Dm          G6         C
Let it snow, let it snow,   and snow

How I'll hate going out in the storm

But if you really grab me tight
A7             D7            G7 G#7
All the way home   I'll be warm
