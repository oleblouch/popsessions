[Verse]

F#              G#m  E
You know this place
              F#
You know this room
                 G#m    E
You've been here before
F#               G#m E
When life is a loop
          F#
Your in a room
          G#m  E
Without a door

[Chorus]
            E
Pick up the phone
    G#m
And answer me at last
B                 F#
Today I will just step out of your past

[Verse]

F#      G#m  E
Trouble that
              F#
We've come to know
               G#m E
Will stay with us
F#         G#m  NC
With every step
          F#
It slowly grows
            G#m  E
Rub off the rust

[Chorus]

            E
Pick up the phone
    G#m
And answer me at last
B                 F#
Today I will just step out of your past
