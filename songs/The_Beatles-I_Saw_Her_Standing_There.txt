[Verse 1]

               E                      A7                E
Well, she was just seventeen, if you know what I mean
                                          B7
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
    E           E7         A       C         E     B7      E
So how could I dance with another     when I saw her standing there


[Verse 2]

       E                    A7         E
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
                                           B7
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
 E            E7          A      C          E            B7       E
She wouldn't dance with another     when I saw her standing there


[Bridge]

          A7
Well, my heart went boom when I crossed that room
                        B       A
And I held her hand in mine...


[Verse 3]

           E                               A7             E
Well, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
                                         B7
And before too long I fell in love with her
     E          E7          A      C           E        B7       E
Now I'll never dance with another     since I saw her standing there


[Instrumental]

(Same as verse)


[Bridge]

          A7
Well, my heart went boom when I crossed that room
                        B       A
And I held her hand in mine...


[Verse 4]

           E                               A7             E
Well, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
                                         B7
And before too long I fell in love with her
     E          E7          A      C           E        B7       E
Now I'll never dance with another     since I saw her standing there
         E        B7       E
Since I saw her standing there
         E        B7       E
Since I saw her standing there
