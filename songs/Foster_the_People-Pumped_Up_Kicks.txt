Fm                       Ab
Robert's got a quick hand
      Eb                             Bb
He'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan
Fm                    Ab
Got a rolled cigarette
Eb                            Bb
Hangin' out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
      Fm                     Ab
Yeah, found a six-shooter gun
       Eb                    Bb
In his dad's closet, oh in a box of fun things
Fm                    Ab
I don't even know what
         Eb                        Bb
But he's comin' for you, yeah he's comin for you, hey

[Chorus]

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

Outrun my gun
Fm                          Ab
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

  Bb
Faster than my bullet

Fm                    Ab
Daddy works a long day
         Eb                     Bb
He'll be coming home late, he's coming home late
         Fm                    Ab
And he's bringing me a surprise
     Eb                                Bb
Cos' dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
     Fm                     Ab
I've waited for a long time
    Eb                          Bb
The slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
  Fm                      Ab
I reason with my cigarette
             Eb                            Bb
And say your hair's on fire you must have lost your wits, yeah
