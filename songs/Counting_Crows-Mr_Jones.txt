[Intro]

Am F Dm G                                       
          Sha la la la la        
Am             F   G               
la la                 uh huh...


[Verse 1]
Am                     F         Dm               G
 I was down at the New Amsterdam  staring at this yellow-haired girl
    Am                       F                G               
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
         Am                    F              Dm                   G
You know she dances while his father plays guitar.  She's suddenly beautiful
   Am                 F         G                     
We all want something beautiful,  man, I wish I was beautiful

        Am                 F                        Dm
So come dance this silence down through the morning
          G              Am      F   G                   
Sha la la la la la la la la yeah       uh huh  yeah
Am         F    Dm                    G
 Cut up, Maria!  Show me some of them Spanish dances
    Am        F           G
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Am           F   Dm                  G
  Believe in me.  Help me believe in anything
       Am           F             G       
'Cause I want to be someone who believes, yeah


[Chorus 1]
C    F           G
 Mr. Jones and me, tell each other fairy tales
    C                          F
and we stare at the beautiful women
       G                     G                        C
"She's looking at you.  Ah, no, no, she's looking at me."
               F             G                      
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
     C              F    G                  
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

[Verse 2]

      Am              F       Dm                G     
Well, I will paint my picture.  Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
Am                    F                    G
 All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful (yeah, well you know)
Am                   F       Dm           G             
Gray is my favorite color  I-I felt so symbolic yesterday
Am           F             G                    
 If I knew Picasso I would buy myself a gray guitar and play


[Chorus 2]

C    F            G
 Mr. Jones and me, look into the future
        C                      F
yeah we stare at the beautiful women
       G                            
"She's looking at you.  Uh, I don't think so.  She's looking at me."
C               F         G
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
     C           F       G                        Am
When everybody lo-ves me,  I will never be lo-one-ly

[Bridge]
                Fmaj7
I will never be lonely
          Am              G
I'm never gonna be looone-ly
Am                   F
I want to be a lion.  Everybody wants to pass as cats
Am                                        G
We all want to be big, big stars, yeah but we got different reasons for that.
Am                       F
 Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
    Am                              G
And I want to be someone to believe, to believe, to believe.


[Chorus 3]

C    F            G
 Mr. Jones and me, stumbling through the barrio
        C                      F
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
       G                             
"She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me."
C                  F
I want to be Bob Dylan
    G                                  
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
    C           F            G                         
When everybody loves you, ah son, that's just about as funky as you can be.

C    F            G
 Mr. Jones and me, staring at the video
       C               F                 G                     
When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me.
C                 F                 G                      
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why, and we don't know how.
         C               F                G                
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as I can be.

C   F            G
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars.....
