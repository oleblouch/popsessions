[Intro]
C#m    B E  G#m B
C#m    B E  G#m
C#m    B E

[Verse 1]
G#m     C#m
Someone said they left together
B      E
I ran out the door to get her
G#m      C#m
She was holding hands with Trevor
B          E
Not the greatest feeling ever
G#m    C#m
Said, "Pull yourself together
B           E
You should try your luck with Heather"
G#m    C#m
Man I heard they slept together
B         E                     G#m C#m B
Oh, the less I know the better
B    E
The less I know the better

[Chorus 1]
       E              C#m      D
Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
       E                         C#m          D         B
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
       E              C#m             D
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
       E                              C#m       D
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
     C#m
So goodbye

[Interlude]
C#m    B E  G#m

[Verse 2]
G#m         C#m
She said, "It's not now or never
B         E
Wait 10 years, we'll be together"
G#m       C#m
I said, "Better late than never
B           E                    G#m C#m B
Just don't make me wait forever"
B      E                   G#m C#m B
Don't make me wait forever
B      E
Don't make me wait forever

[Chorus 2]
       E              C#m      D
Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
           E                             C#m       D
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind

[Outro]
E                 G#m
I was doing fine without ya
C#m                    A
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
E                     G#m
Giving in to all his bullshit
C#m                    A
Is this what you want, is this who you are?
E                  G#m
I was doing fine without ya
C#m                   A
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
E                            G#m
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
       C#m                A                     E G#m
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
       C#m                A                     E G#m
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
       C#m                A                     E G#m C#m A
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
