[Intro]
D G A D   D G A Bm  G A D D

[Verse]
         D                   G
Ah well, you might think I'm crazy
   A                D
To hang around with you
D                   G
Maybe you think I'm lucky
   A                 D
To have something to do

[Pre-chorus]
      Bm    A           G
but I think that you're wild
      Bm      A       G
And inside me is some child

[Chorus]
D                   G
You might think I'm foolish
   A            Bm   Bm/C#
Or maybe it's untrue (you might think)
D                   G
You might think I'm crazy (all I want)
    A             D    G   A
But all I want is you

[Verse]
D                       G
You might think it's hysterical
    A                  D
But I know when you're weak
    D                   G
You think you're in the movies
    A               D
And everything's so deep

[Pre-chorus]
      Bm    A           G
But I think that you're wild
         Bm         A       G
When you flash that fragile smile

[Chorus]
D                    G
You might think it's foolish
A                 Bm    Bm/C#
What you put me through (you might think)
D                   G
You might think I'm crazy (all I want)
    A             D    D
But all I want is you

[Bridge]
           Bm   G   A       Bm
And it was hard, so hard to take
G        A    Bm
 There's no escape,
G    A     Bm   G A G
 Without a scrape
G  N.C.
   But you kept it going till the sun fell down
A  N.C.
   You kept it going

[Instrumental]
D G A D   D G A Bm  G A D

[Verse]
         D                     G
Ah well, you might think I'm delirious
    A             D
The way I run you down
    D                    G
But somewhere, sometime, when you're curious
A             D
I'll be back around

[Pre-chorus]
      Bm    A           G
And I think that you're wild
    Bm   A      G
And so uniquely styled

[Chorus]
D                     G
You might think it's foolish
     A             Bm   Bm/C#
This chancey rendezvous (you might think)
D                   G
You might think I'm crazy (all I want)
    A             D
But all I want is you
G     A       Bm
All I want is you
      G    A  D
all I want is you
