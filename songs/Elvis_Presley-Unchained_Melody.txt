[Verse]
G       Em      C
Oh, my love, my darling
     D                 G
I've hungered for your touch
  Em          D     D
A long lonely time


[Chorus]
G         Em    C
Time goes by so slowly
    D              G
And time can do so much
    Em        D      D
Are you still mine?


G              D
I need your love
Em    Bm
I need your love
 C                    D     G     G7
God speed your love  to    me
C             D           C           Bb
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
C           D           G
To the open arms of the sea
C             D            C            Bb
Lonely rivers cry wait for me, wait for me
C              D             G
I'll be coming home wait for me


G     Em       C
Oh my love, my darling
     D                G
I've hungered for your touch
Em            D     D
A long lonely time


[Chorus]
G         Em    C
Time goes by so slowly
    D              G
And time can do so much
    Em        D      D
Are you still mine?


G              D
I need your love
Em    Bm
I need your love
 C                    D     G
God speed your love  to    me
