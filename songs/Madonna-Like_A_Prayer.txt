Like a Prayer - Madonna


[Intro] (voices)
Dm        C Gm Dm
Life is a mystery
Dm            C     Gm   Dm
Everyone must stand a - lone
Dm         C    Gm  F
I hear you call my name
Bb     F     C     Dm 
And it feels like home


[Chorus]
F                 C
When you call my name
                      Bb
It's like a little prayer
                 F/A
I'm down on my knees
        Dm   C   F
I wanna take you there
F                C
In the midnight hour
                  Bb
I can feel your power
               F/A
Just like a prayer
              Dm   C   Bb
You know I'll take you there


[Verse]
Bb           F
I hear your voice
C            Dm
It's like an angel sighing
Bb        F                  C
I have no choice I hear your voice
C
Feels like flying
Bb           F
I close my eyes
C            Dm
Oh God I think I'm falling
Bb        F                   C
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
C
Heaven help me


[Chorus]
F                 C
When you call my name
                      Bb
It's like a little prayer
                 F/A
I'm down on my knees
        Dm   C   F
I wanna take you there
F                C
In the midnight hour
                  Bb
I can feel your power
               F/A
Just like a prayer
              Dm   C   Bb
You know I'll take you there


[Verse]
Bb           F
Like a child
C            Dm
You whisper softly to me
Bb        F                  C
You're in control just like a child
C
Now I'm dancing
Bb           F
It's like a dream
C            Dm
No end and no beginning
Bb        F
You're here with me it's like a dream
C
Let the choir sing


[Chorus]
F                 C
When you call my name
                      Bb
It's like a little prayer
                 F/A
I'm down on my knees
        Dm   C   F
I wanna take you there
F                C
In the midnight hour
                  Bb
I can feel your power
               F/A
Just like a prayer
              Dm   C   Bb
You know I'll take you there
