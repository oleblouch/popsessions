[Verse 1]

C                               E7                          F
This is Ground Control to Major Tom, you've really made the grade
        Fm             C                     F
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
         Fm                C              F
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

C                              E7                             F
This is Major Tom to Ground Control, I'm stepping through the door
        Fm            C               F
And I'm floating in a most a-peculiar way
        Fm              C           F
And the stars look very different today


[Chorus]

    Fmaj7     Em7                   Fmaj7         Em7
For here am I sitting in a tin can, far above the world
Bb              Am               G             F
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do

C                                    E7                      F
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles, I'm feeling very still
      Fm                 C                  F
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
        Fm              C             F
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows

G                 E7
Ground Control to Major Tom
     Am                      Am7/G
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
        D7
Can you hear me Major Tom?
        C/G
Can you hear me Major Tom?
        G
Can you hear me Major Tom? Can you...


[Chorus]

Fmaj7     Em7                        Fmaj7         Em7
Here am I floating round my tin can, far above the moon
Bb              Am               G             F
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do
