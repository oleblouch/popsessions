[Verse]
D                       C        
Please allow me to introduce myself
      G      G/B   [c#] D
I'm a man of wealth and taste
D                      C
I've been around for a long, long year
      G            G/B [c#] D
Stole many a man's soul and faith


[Verse]
D                     C
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
        G         G/B  [c#] D
Had his moment of doubt and pain
                    C
Made damn sure that Pilate
           G         G/B   [c#] | D | % |
Washed his hands and sealed his fate


[Chorus]
A                  
 Pleased to meet you
D A                 | D   Dsus4 | D |
   Hope you guess my name
           A
But what's puzzling you
D      A            | D   Dsus4 | D |
Is the  nature of my game


[Verse]
D                   C
 I stuck around St. Petersburg
       G                 G/B [c#] D     Dsus4 D
When I saw it was a time for  a   change
D                        C
 Killed the Czar and his ministers
    G     G/B     [c#] D    Dsus4 D
Anastasia screamed in  vain


[Verse]
D                      C
 I rode a tank, held a general's rank
         G                G/B [c#] D            Dsus4 D | D |
When the Blitzkrieg raged and  the bodies stank


[Chorus]
A                  
 Pleased to meet you
D A                 | D   Dsus4 | D |
   Hope you guess my name
           A
But what's puzzling you
D       A            | D   Dsus4 | D |
 Is the  nature of my game


[Verse]
D                               C
 I watched with glee while your kings and queens
           G           G/B [c#] D               Dsus4 D
Fought for ten decades for the  Gods they made
  D                           C
I shouted out "Who killed the Kennedys?"
     G         G/B [c#] D            Dsus4 D
When after all  it  was you and me


[Verse]
D                   C
 Let me please introduce myself
      G      G/B   [c#] D       Dsus4 D
I'm a man of wealth and taste
D                     C
 And I laid traps for troubadours
        G                         G/B [c#] D       Dsus4 D | D |
Who get killed before they reached Bom  -  bay 


[Chorus]
A                  
 Pleased to meet you
D A                 | D   Dsus4 | D |
   Hope you guess my name
           A
But what's puzzling you
D       A            | D   Dsus4 | D |
 Is the  nature of my game       (Oh yeah, get down, baby)

[Chorus]
A                  
 Pleased to meet you
D A                 | D   Dsus4 | D |
   Hope you guess my name
              A
But what's confusing you
D            A            | D   Dsus4 | D |
 Is just the  nature of my game       


[Verse]
        D              C
Just as every cop is a criminal
    G               D
And all the sinners saints
   D                            C
As heads is tails, just call me   Lucifer
              G              D
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint


[Verse]
          D                 C
So if you meet me have some courtesy
          G                  D
Have some sympathy, and some taste
    D                     C
Use all your well-learned politesse
        G                D
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah


[Chorus]
A                  
 Pleased to meet you
D A                 | D   Dsus4 | D |
   Hope you guess my name
           A
But what's puzzling you
D       A            | D   Dsus4 | D |
 Is the  nature of my game
