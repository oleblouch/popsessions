The Clash-London Calling

 So many people seem to think there is a C chord in London Calling and there
 simply is not. It is the bass that plays the C (Which is the 5th instead of
 the root) while the guitar is playing the F. When you play this at home without 
 a bass it might sound weird because you want to hear that C but it's not the 
 guitar playing it. This is explained in greater detail by Marcus Gray in his book,
 "Route 19 Revisited: The Clash and London Calling," which disects London Calling
 track by track. I've also pulled up every live video I can find with any sort of
 detail as to what Joe is playing. - Gharms85

This is the main rhythm guitar that is loudest in the mix.

[Verse 1] 
Em                    F
London calling to the faraway towns
    Em                   G
Now war is declared, and battle come down
Em                    F
London calling to the underworld
Em                            G
Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls
Em                  F
London calling, now don't look to us
Em                     G
Phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust
Em                     F
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
Em                         G
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing


[Chorus 1]
Em                        G
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Em                     G
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
Em                       G
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
Em                             D (let ring)
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river


[Verse 2]
Em                    F
London calling to the imitation zone
Em                          G                          
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
Em                    F
London calling to the zombies of death
Em                    G
Quit holding out, and draw another breath
Em                    F
London calling, and I don't wanna shout
    Em                       G
But while we were talking, I saw you nodding out
Em                     F
London calling, see we ain't got no high
Em                           G
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes


[Chorus 2] 
Em                         G
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Em                        G
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
Em                   G
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Em                             D (let ring)
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river


[Interlude] (Play the same as the verse)
Em F Em G  x4


[Chorus 2] 
Em                         G
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Em                        G
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
Em                   G
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Em                             D (let ring)
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river

[Verse 3]
Em                   F
London calling, yes, I was there, too
Em                           G
An' you know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
Em                    F
London calling at the top of the dial
Em              G
After all this, won't you give me a smile?
Em                   F
London calling
Em                   F

[Outro]
Em
I never felt so much alike [fading] alike alike alike
