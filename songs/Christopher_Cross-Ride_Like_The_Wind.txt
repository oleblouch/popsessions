It is the night. My body's weak 
           Cm7              Bb 
I'm on the run. No time for sleep

I've got to ride, Ride like the wind to be free again 
      Abmaj9                 Gm9 
And I got such a long way to go 
   Abmaj9                  Gm9   
To make it to the border of Mexico. 
        Cm7              Bb

I was born the son of a lawless man. 
        Cm7                 Bb 
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand. 
           Bb/Ab             Bb 
Lived nine lives gunned down ten. 
                    Cm7      Bb 
Gonna ride like the wind. 
      Abmaj9                 Gm9 
And I got such a long way to go

To make it to the border of Mexico. 
        Cm7              Bb

[Verse 2]
Cm7                    Bb 
Accused and tried and told to hang 
      Cm7                        Bb  
I was no where in sight when the church bells rang. 
              Bb/Ab               Bb 
Never was the kind to do as I was told. 
                    Cm7               Bb 
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old.
