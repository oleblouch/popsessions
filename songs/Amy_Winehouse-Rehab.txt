[Chorus 1]
     C7
They try to make me go to rehab; I said "no, no, no".
 C7 
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.
G7                               F7
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine;
      C7                     F7            C7
He's tried to make me go to rehab; I won't go, go, go.

[Verse 1]
Em                      Am      F                     Ab
 I'd rather be at home with Ray, I ain't got seventy days.
              Em                               Am
'Cos there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me,
     F                      Ab
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway.

[Pre-Chorus 1]
G7
 I didn't get a lot in class,
       F7
But I know it don't come in a shot glass.

[Chorus 2]
     C7
They try to make me go to rehab; I said "no, no, no".
 C7 
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.
G7                               F7
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine;
      C7                     F7            C7
He's tried to make me go to rehab; I won't go, go, go.

[Verse 2]
Em                             Am        F                 Ab
 The man said why do you think you here? I said; I got no idea.
     Em                        Am
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, lose my baby,
F                   Ab
So I always keep a bottle near.

[Pre-Chorus 2]
G7
 He said I just think you're depressed,
F7
 This me, yeah baby and the rest.

[Chorus 3]
     C7
They try to make me go to rehab; I said "no, no, no".
 C7 
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.

[Verse 3]
Em                       Am
 I don't ever want to drink again,
F                     Ab
 I just, ooh I just, need a friend.
Em                   Am
 I'm not gonna spend ten weeks,
     F                      Ab
And have everyone think I'm on the mend

[Pre-Chorus 3]
G7
 And it's not just my pride;
F7
 It's just 'till these tears have dried.

[Chorus 4]
     C7
They try to make me go to rehab; I said "no, no, no".
 C7 
Yes I've been black but when I come back; you'll know, know, know.
G7                               F7
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine;
      C7                     F7            C7
He's tried to make me go to rehab; I won't go, go, go.
