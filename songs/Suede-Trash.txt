[Verse 1]
C                                Em
Maybe, maybe it's the clothes we wear
                                          Fmaj7
The tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair
              D          G
Maybe it's our kookiness

C                                Em
Or maybe, maybe it's our nowhere towns
                                     Fmaj7
Our nothing places and our cellophane sounds
               D          G
Maybe it's our looseness

[Chorus]
           C            Gm
But we're trash, you and me
                       F
We're the litter on the breeze
                        Fm       Adim
We're the lovers on the streets
     C              Gm
Just trash, me and you
                     F
It's in everything we do
                     Ab
It's in everything we do

[Verse 2]
C                                Em
Maybe, maybe it's the things we say
                                     Fmaj7
The words we've heard and the music we play
              D          G
Maybe it's our cheapness

C                                Em
Or maybe, maybe it's the times we've had
                                   Fmaj7
The lazy days and the crazes and the fads
             D            G
Maybe it's our sweetness

[Chorus]
           C            Gm
But we're trash, you and me
                       F
We're the litter on the breeze
                        Fm       Adim
We're the lovers on the streets
     C              Gm
Just trash, me and you
                     F
It's in everything we do
                     Ab
It's in everything we do

[Chorus]
     C                  Gm
But we're trash, you and me,
                          F
We're the lovers on the street,
                        Fm      Adim
We're the litter on the breeze,
C                   Gm
Just trash, me and you,
                      F
It's in everything we do,
                     Ab      Adim
It's in everything we do
