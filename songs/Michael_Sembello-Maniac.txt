[Verse 1]

         Em                  Em6
Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
        Em7                 Em (Emaj7)
Looking for the fight of her life
        C                      Cadd9
in the real time world no one sees her at all
       Cadd9 (Cadd13)  B7sus4 B7
they all say she's crazy

               Em                  Em6
Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
        Em7                 Em (Emaj7)
Changing movement into light
             C                      Cadd9
She had danced into the danger zone
             Cadd9 (Cadd13)        B7sus4 B7
When the dancer becomes the dance


[Pre-Chorus 1]

A7                      B7                             C
It can cut you like a knife if the gift becomes the fire
       B7 (B13)           B7
On the wire between will and what will be


[Chorus 1]

         C         D          Em
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
          C                  D            Em
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

         C         D          Em
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
          C                  D            A
And she's dancing like she's never danced before


[Verse 2]

         Em                  Em6
On the ice blue line of insanity
        Em7                 Em (Emaj7)
is a place most never see
        C                      Cadd9
It's a hard won place of mystery
       Cadd9 (Cadd13)  B7sus4 B7
touch it but can't hold it

         Em                  Em6
You work all your life, for that moment in time
        Em7                 Em(Emaj7)
It could come or pass you by
        C                      Cadd9
it's a push shove world but there's always a chance
      Cadd9 (Cadd13)         B7sus4 B7
if the hunger stays the night


[Pre-Chorus 2]

A7                      B7                                 C
There's a cold kinetic heat struggling stretching for the peak
                        B7 (B13)           B7
Never stopping with her head against the wind


[Chorus 2]

         C         D           Em
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
          C                  D            Em
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

         C         D           Em
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
          C                  D            A
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Pre-Chorus 1]

A7                     B7                           C
It can cut you like a knife if the gift becomes the fire
       B7 (B13)           B7
On the wire between will and what will be


[Chorus 2]

         C         D           Em
She's a maniac, maniac at your door

And she's dancing like she's never danced before

         C         D           Em
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
          C                  D            A
And she's dancing like she's never danced before


[Outro]

 C       D             Em 
Maniac, maniac at your door (I sure know)
          C                  D            A
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
