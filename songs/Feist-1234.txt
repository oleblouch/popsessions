[Verse 1]
C         C/B
One, two, three, four
Am               F
Tell me that you love me more
C         C/B
Sleepless long nights
Am              F
That is what my youth was for
C       Dm            Am             F
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
C               Dm        Am             F
Left you with nothing but they want some more


[Chorus]
G                 F
Oh, uh oh, you're changing your heart
G              F
Oh, uh oh, you know who you are


[Verse 2]
C           C/B          Am             F
Sweetheart, bitter heart now I can tell you apart
C     C/B      Am               F
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
C         Dm                  Am             F
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
C             Dm        Am          F
Too scared to own up to one little lie


[Chorus]
G                 F
Oh, uh oh, you're changing your heart
G              F
Oh, uh oh, you know who you are


[Verse 3]
C          C/B         Am         F
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten

Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
C         C/B          Am         F
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
C           C/B     Am                  F      C      C/B  Am  F     C  C/B  Am  F
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then


[Chorus]
G                 F
Oh, uh oh, you're changing your heart
G              F N.C
Oh, uh oh, you know who you are


[Outro]
C          C/B
For the teenage boys
Am      F
They're breaking your heart
C        C/B
For the teenage boys
Am      F
They're breaking your heart
