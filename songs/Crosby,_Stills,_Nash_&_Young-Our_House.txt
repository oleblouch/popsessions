[Intro]

A              Amaj7
I'll light the fire
F#m           A              D
You place the flowers in the vase
         A        D   D  E
That you bought today

[Verse 1]

A              Amaj7
Staring at the fire
    F#m       A
For hours and hours
        D      A      D         E
While I listen to you play your love songs
D         E        A Amaj7
All night long for me
F#m      A D   F
Only for me

[Verse 2]

A          Amaj7
Come to me now
    F#m                A
And rest your head for just five minutes
D    A        D  E
Everything is done
A           Amaj7
Such a cozy room
    F#m           A
The windows are illuminated
D      A       D        E
By the evening sunshine through them
D     E        A  Amaj7
Fiery gems for you
F#m      A D  F
Only for you

[Chorus]

A   Amaj7       F#m                   A
Our house, is a very, very, very fine house
     D               A
With two cats in the yard
     D             A
Life used to be so hard
    D             A              D      Bm  D
Now everything is easy 'cause of you    and I

[Bridge]

A  Amaj7  F#m  A   D  A   D  E  E7
La la la...
A  Amaj7  F#m  A   D  F
La la la...

[Chorus]

A   Amaj7       F#m                   A
Our house, is a very, very, very fine house
     D               A
With two cats in the yard
     D             A
Life used to be so hard
    D             A              D   Bm  D
Now everything is easy 'cause of you

A              Amaj7
I'll light the fire
      F#m           A              D
While you place the flowers in the vase
         F        A  A
