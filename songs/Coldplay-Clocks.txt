Lights go out and I can't be saved, tides that I tried to swim against

  come back and take you home, I could not stop that you now know - singing
D           Am                             Em
  Come out upon my seas, curse missed opportunities - am I
D        Am                             Em
  A part of the cure, or am I a part of the disease? - singing
