[Intro]

C     D7     Fmaj7     Esus4  E          x2

[Verse 1]
C                   D7
High on diesel and gasoline,
           Fmaj7
Psycho for drum machine
              Esus4        E
Shaking their bits to the hits

C                    D7
Drag acts, drugs and suicides
              Fmaj7
In your dad's suits you hide
         Esus4        E
Staining his name again

C                      D7
Cracked up, shacked up, 22
          Fmaj7
Psycho for sex and glue
         Esus4     E
Lost it Bostick, yeah

C                                D7
Shaved heads, raves heads, on the pill
             Fmaj7
Got too much time to kill
         Esus4        E
Get into bands and gangs


[Chorus]
C                   Em
Here they come, the beautiful ones
    F                Dm    Bb
The beautiful ones - la la la la

C                   Em
Here they come, the beautiful ones
    F                Dm    Bb
The beautiful ones - la la la la

Am


[Verse 2]
C                         D7
Loved up, doved up, hung around,
            Fmaj7
Stoned in a lonely town
               Esus4        E
Shaking their meat to the beat

C                   D7
High on diesel and gasoline,
           Fmaj7
Psycho for drum machine
              Esus4        E
Shaking their bits to the hits


[Chorus]
C                   Em
Here they come, the beautiful ones
    F                Dm    Bb
The beautiful ones - la la la la

C                   Em
Here they come, the beautiful ones
    F               Dm    Bb
The beautiful ones  Ohhhhh


[Bridge 1]
                 C
You don't think about it
                 Em
You don't do without it
               F          Dm    Bb
Because you're beautiful

[Bridge 2]
            C            Em          
And If your baby's going crazy       
               F          Dm    Bb   
That's how you made me                x3

Am


[Outro]
C          D7
La la la la la la la
           Fmaj7
La la la la la la
           Esus4 E
La la la la la la la                 repeat
