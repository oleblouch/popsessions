           E                           A       A5  A
It still feels like our first night together
E                       F#m
Feels like the first kiss and it's getting better, baby
C#m          D
No one can better this
A                                         E    A
You're still holding on, you're still the one
                           C#                   F#m
The first time our eyes met, same feeling I get
                           C#                         A
Only it feels much stronger, I wanna love you longer
                        E
You still turn the fire on

So if you're feeling lonely, don't
E                          A
You're the only one I ever want
       F#m    A             D
I only wanna make it good
E                         F#m        D
So if I love you a little more than I should...

Can't get close enough
A                                            E  
You're still holding on, you're still number one
A                                 C#                     F#m
I remember the smell of your skin,  I remember everything
                          C#           
I remember all your moves, I remember you, yeah!
