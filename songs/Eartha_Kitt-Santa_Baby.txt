Think of all the fun I've missed,

If you'll check off my Christmas list.

Santa Baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot

Been an angel all year, Santa Baby,

Santa honey, one little thing I really need -- the deed

To a platinum mine, Santa Baby,

So hurry down the chimney tonight.

Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex and checks

Sign your 'x' on the line, Santa cutie,

So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree

B7
With some decorations bought at Tif-fa-ny 

E7
I really do believe in you --

Let's see if you believe in me

Santa Baby, forgot to mention one little thing -- a ring 

A7     A7sus4         D           B7
I don't mean on the phone, Santa Baby,

So hurry down the chimney tonight.
