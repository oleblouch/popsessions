The lake of InnisFree - Yeats
 
 
E        A2       E   A2
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
 B7       C#m       A2       B7
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:
E        A2       E       A2
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
 Em4/b  Cmaj7          B7
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.
 
  E         A2       E    A2
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
 B7           C#m     A2       B7
Dropping from the veils of the mourning to where the cricket sings;
 E         A2      E       A2
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
 Em4/b  Cmaj7          B7
And evening full of the linnet's wings.
 
 E        A2       E   A2
I will arise and go now, for always night and day
 B7       C#m      A2       B7
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
 E        A2       E        A2
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
 Em4/b  Cmaj7          B7
I hear it in the deep heart's core.
