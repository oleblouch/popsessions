Robert Frost – Into my own
 
intro sur refrain : a - c - bb - a - e - a - e - d  
Dm – Gm7 – C7 – Dm

Dm                          Gm7
ONE of my wishes is that those dark trees,
C7                    Dm
So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,
Dm                          Gm7
Were not, as ’twere, the merest mask of gloom,
C7                          Dm
But stretched away unto the edge of doom.
 
Bb – F – Am - Dm
 
I should not be withheld but that some day   	
Into their vastness I should steal away, 
Fearless of ever finding open land,  
Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand. 	
 
I do not see why I should e’er turn back,
Or those should not set forth upon my track	   	
To overtake me, who should miss me here  
And long to know if still I held them dear.	

bridge sur couplet : a - d - e - f - f - e / a - c - d - e - e - d

They would not find me changed from him they knew— 
Only more sure of all I thought was true.
