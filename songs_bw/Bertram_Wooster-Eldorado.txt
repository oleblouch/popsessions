Eldorado
 Accord de D tenu sur basse de : D - Em - Bm - G
Puis : A - Bm - G – Gm

D
Gaily bedight,
Em
A gallant knight,
Bm                  G
In sunshine and in shadow,
A
Had journeyed long,
Bm
Singing a song,
G               Gm
In search of Eldorado.
 
But he grew old-
This knight so bold-
And o'er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado.
 
And, as his strength
Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim shadow-
"Shadow," said he,
"Where can it be-
This land of Eldorado?"
 
Pont : A - Bbaug - Bmin7 – C(+f#)
 
"Over the Mountains
Of the Moon,
Down the Valley of the Shadow,
Ride, boldly ride,"
The shade replied-
"If you seek for Eldorado!"
Fin : D - /E - /F# - /G - /A - /Bb - /B – C(+f#) – C(+f#) - D
