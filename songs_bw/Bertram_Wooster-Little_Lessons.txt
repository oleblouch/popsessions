INTRO : E – Am/F – A/F# - Am/F

    E                         		Am/F
THE love I bear you, dearest,
                                    A/F#
Would make the sweetest tale,
                                    Am/F
We'd sail upon a sea of bliss,
                                    E
And I would lift the sail.

Our happiness would be sublime,
Surpassing tongue or pen.
You may as well learn things from me,
As to learn from other men.

    E                            F#m7
"Oh! you have touched me--deeply--"
                            C/G
The young thing whispered low.
                                   B
He pleaded: "Come! oh! come with me."

She could not answer: "No."
 
MOTIF : E – Am/F – A/F# - Am/F

They dined alone that evening,
And the young man got his wish.
They even broke the unwritten law
Of: "Nevaire before zee feesh."

At half-past three, next morning,
He staggered home again.
She had taught him tricks he never knew,
That she'd learned from other men.
