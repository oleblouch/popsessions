STARS

Surprisingly bell still vibrate,
Spread fear from standing close
Thank countless stars for your twinkling gleam
And the path you do expose

It sounds like echoes to my fate
Bonfire is cooling down
I need hope, heat and a place to rest
I 'll kindle it 'till dawn

' Shelter my eyes from descending rays,
Omens that cleave the night
Praise the sun, I've found the signs
Despite the lack of light
