STARS

C
Surprisingly bell still vibrate,
    Am
Spread fear from standing close
    G           
Thank countless stars for your twinkling gleam
    F   
And the path you do expose

It sounds like echoes to my fate
Bonfire is cooling down
I need hope, heat and a place to rest
I 'll kindle it 'till dawn

' Shelter my eyes from descending rays,
Omens that cleave the night
Praise the sun, I've found the signs
Despite the lack of light
