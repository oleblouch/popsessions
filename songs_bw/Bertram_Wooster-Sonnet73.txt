That time of year
   you may in me behold
When yellow leaves, 
   or none, or few, do hang

Upon those boughs 
   which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, 
   where late (the) sweet birds sang.


In me you see 
   (the) twilight of such day
As after sunset 
   fades in the west,


Which by and by 
   black night takes away,
Death's second self, 
   that seals up all in rest.


In me you see
   (the) glowing of such fire
That on the ashes 
   of his youth does lie,


As the death-bed 
   whereon it must expire
Consumed with that 
   which it was nourish'd by.


This you perceive, 
   which makes your love more strong,
To love that well which you 
   must leave ere long.
