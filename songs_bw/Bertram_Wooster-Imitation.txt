C 			            Am
Time is a taper waning fast!
                                    C
Use it, man, well whilst it doth last:
                        			Am
Lest burning downwards it consume away,
            G	        G7				    C
Before thou hast commenced the labour of the day.

Time is a pardon of a goodly soil!
Plenty shall crown thine honest toil:
But if uncultivated, rankest weeds
Shall choke the efforts of the rising seeds.


Time is a leasehold of uncertain date!
Granted to thee by everlasting fate.
Neglect not thou, ere thy short term expire,
To save thy soul from ever-burning fire.
