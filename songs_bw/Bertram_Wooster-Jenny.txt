Jenny kissed me when we met,
                         	d:e:c (Dm/A)
Jumping from the chair she sat in;
e:g:c  	d#:f#:c         	(C - Cdim7)
Time, you thief, who love to get
d:f:c (Gm7)          	c#:f:c	(/Bbm6)
Sweets into your list, put that in:
 
 
Pont : Am - D7+ - Gm - C7
 
 
Say I’m weary, say I’m sad,
 
Say that health and wealth have missed me,
 
Say I’m growing old, but add
 
Jenny kissed me.
