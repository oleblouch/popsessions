Go, lovely rose! Tell her that wastes her time and me
Em              Bm      Am          Bm          Am      Bm
That now she knows, When I resemble her to thee,
Am                      Bm          C       D7
How sweet and fair she seems to be.

[CHORUS]
                G       F    Em                  D
Tell her that's young,     and shuns to have her graces spied,
G               F           Em          D          C
That hadst thou sprung in deserts, where no men abide,
C
Thou must have uncommended died.

G           F         Cmaj7           D
Small is the worth of beauty from the light retired;
Em              Bm    Am                Bm          Am      Bm
Bid her come forth,   suffer herself to be desired,
Am                  Bm          C       D7
And not blush so to be admired.

[CHORUS]
                G       F    Em                  D
Then die! that she          the common fate of all things rare
G               F           Em               D          C
May read in thee;       how small a part of time they share
C
That are so wondrous sweet and fair!

That are so wondrous sweet and fair!
