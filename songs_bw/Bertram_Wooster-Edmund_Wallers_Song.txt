G           F       
Go, lovely rose! 
    Cmaj7           D
Tell her that wastes her time and me
Em              Bm    
That now she knows, 
  Am          Bm          Am      Bm
When I resemble her to thee,
Am                      Bm          C    D7
How sweet and fair she seems to be.

[CHORUS]
                G       F    
Tell her that's young,     
Em                  D
and shuns to have her graces spied,
G               F           Em  
That hadst thou sprung in deserts, 
D          C
where no men abide,
C
Thou must have uncommended died.

G           F         
Small is the worth of 
Cmaj7           D
beauty from the light retired;
Em              Bm    
Bid her come forth,   
Am                Bm          Am      Bm
suffer herself to be desired,
Am                  Bm        C       D7
And not blush so to be admired.

[CHORUS]
                G       F
Then die! that she          
Em                  D
the common fate of all things rare
G               F          
May read in thee;      
 Em               D          C 
how small a part of time they share
C
That are so wondrous sweet and fair!
