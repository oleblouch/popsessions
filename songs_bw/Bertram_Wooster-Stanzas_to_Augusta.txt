G           A           Bm          D
When all around grew drear and dark,
G
And reason half withheld her ray
A                       D
And hope but shed a dying spark
Gm          A           D
Which more misled my lonely way;

In that deep midnight of the mind,
And that internal strife of heart,
When dreading to be deemed too kind,
The weak despair -the cold depart;

When fortune changed -and love fled far,
And hatred's shafts flew thick and fast,
Thou wert the solitary star
Which rose, and set not to the last.

Oh, blest be thine unbroken light!
That watched me as a seraph's eye,
And stood between me and the night,
For ever shining sweetly nigh.

And when the cloud upon us came,
Which strove to blacken o'er thy ray -
Then purer spread its gentle flame,
And dashed the darkness all away.

Still may thy spirit dwell on mine,
And teach it what to brave or brook -
There's more in one soft word of thine
Than in the world's defied rebuke.
