A             Dm B7
Accept, dear girl, this little token,
      	E      E7              A
And if between the lines you seek,
A   	Dm             	B7
You'll find the love I've often spoken
      	E  	E7                A
The love my dying lips shall speak.
 
A    	  D         	Bm
Our little ones are making merry
 	   	E  	E7                  A
O'er am'rous ditties rhymed in jest,
A    	  D         	Bm
But in these words (though awkward very)
		E  	E7            Dm
The genuine article's expressed.

Dm   A	 B7	E
PA LA PA PA ..

A   	Dm             	B7
You are as fair and sweet and tender,
      	E  	E7
Dear brown-eyed little sweetheart mine,
A   	Dm             	B7
As when, a callow youth and slender,
      	E  	E7
I asked to be your Valentine.
A    	  D         	Bm
What though these years of ours be fleeting?
      	E  	E7
What though the years of youth be flown?
A    	  D         	Bm
I'll mock old Tempus with repeating,
      	E  	E7
"I love my love and her alone!"

Dm   A	 B7	E

A   	Dm             	B7
And when I fall before his reaping,
      	E  	E7
And when my stuttering speech is dumb,
A   	Dm             	B7
Think not my love is dead or sleeping,
      	E  	E7
But that it waits for you to come.
A    	  D         	Bm
So take, dear love, this little token,
      	E  	E7
And if there speaks in any line
A    	  D         	Bm
The sentiment I'd fain have spoken,
      	E  	E7
Say, will you kiss your  Valentine?

Dm   A	 B7	E
