I live under the sea, look at me
D		A
Got time and water
Bm7				A
I'm such a quiet lobster

A
Don't skim pebble stones
Bm7
Vibrations that you cause
D			   A
Disturb my peaceful, aquatic heartbeat
Bm7			E	E7
I chose my life not to suffer from you

I live under the sea, look at me
D		A
Got time and water

I'm such a quiet lobster

F#m7
My shellâ€™s stronger than a shield
	Dmaj7
And I can pinch
All humans in the world

Living on my own
Bm7
Playing with my claws
D 					A
Makes me so happy, can't you see
Bm7			E	E7
That I won't share it with anybody

A		Bm7
I live under the sea, look at me
D		A
Got time and water
Bm7				A
I'm such a quiet lobster

A		Bm7
I live under the sea, look at me
D		A
Got time and water

I'm such a quiet lobster
