F                           Bb
No vows written to wed you,I write them white,
    Gm7             A7                          Ebmaj7
my lips on yours,light in the soft hours of our married years.
F                           Bb
No prayers written to bless you,I write them white,
    Gm7             A7                          Ebmaj7
your soul a flame,bright in the window of your maiden name.

F                           Bb
No laws written to guard you,I write them white,
    Gm7             A7                          Ebmaj7
your hand in mine,palm against palm, lifeline, heartline.
F                           Bb
No rules written to guide you,I write them white,
    Gm7             A7                          Ebmaj7
words on the wind,traced with a stick where we walk on the sand.
