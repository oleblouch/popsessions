C
My boat is on the shore,
And my bark is on the sea;
F
But, before I go, Tom Moore,
Here's a double health to thee!
Am
Here's a sigh to those who love me,
And a smile to those who hate;
Em
And, whatever sky's above me,
				F		
Here's a heart for every fate.
 
Though the ocean roar around me,
Yet it still shall bear me on;
Though a desert (d é z oe r t) should surround me,
It hath springs that may be won.
Were't the last drop in the well,
As I gasp'd upon the brink,
Ere my fainting spirit fell,
'Tis to thee that I would drink.
 
With that water, as this wine,
The libation (l a y) I would pour (p ou r)
Should be -peace with thine and mine,
And a health to thee, Tom Moore!
