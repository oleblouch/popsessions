WHEN we two parted
             /Eb  Edim  F  
  In silence and tears, 
/F#  Gm
Half broken-hearted 
                           A7#9
  To sever for years,  
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
  Colder thy kiss;       
Truly that hour foretold
  Sorrow to this.

The dew of the morning            Sunk chill on my brow—
Gm7                                                  Bbm                             Bdim
It felt like the warning Of what I feel now. Of what I feel now.
Thy vows are all broken,  And light is thy fame:
I hear thy name spoken, And share in its shame. And share in its shame.
             
They name thee before me, 
  A knell to mine ear;  
A shudder comes o'er me—  
  Why wert thou so dear?         
They know not I knew thee,  
  Who knew thee too well:     
Long, long shall I rue thee,      
  Too deeply to tell.    
 
In secret we met—      
  In silence I grieve,      
That thy heart could forget,   
  Thy spirit deceive. Thy spirit deceive.
If I should meet thee  
  After long years,        
How should I greet thee?        
  With silence and tears. With silence and tears.
