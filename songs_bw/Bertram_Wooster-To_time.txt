Couplets : Dm9 - Cmaj7 

TIME! on whose arbitrary wing   The varying hours must flag or fly,
Whose tardy winter, fleeting spring,   But drag or drive us on to die
Hail thou! who on my birth bestow'd Those boons to all that know thee known;
Yet better I sustain thy load, For now I bear the weight alone.
 
Refrain : Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7 - C7 (x3)

I would not one fond heart should share
   The bitter moments thou hast given;
And pardon thee, since thou could'st spare
   All that I loved, to peace or heaven.
To them be joy or rest, on me
   Thy future ills shall press in vain;
I nothing owe but years to thee,
  	Dm7   G7	G7#5b9 
   A debt already paid in pain.
 
Bridge : 1 motif couplet
 
Yet even that pain was some relief it felt but still forgot thy power
The active agony of grief Retards, but never counts the hour.

Bridge : 1 motif couplet 

In joy I've sigh'd to think thy flight would soon subside from swift to slow
Thy cloud could overcast the light, But could not add a night to woe
 
Modif : Fmaj7 - Am7 - Em7 - F - G

For then, however drear and dark, My soul was suited to thy sky;
One star alone shot forth a spark To prove then - not Eternity.
That beam hath sunk and now thou art A blank a thing to count and curse
Through each dull tedious trifling part, Which all regret, yet all rehearse.
  
One scene even thou canst not deform;
 The limit of thy sloth or speed
When future wanderers bear the storm
Which we shall sleep too sound to heed:
And I can smile to think how weak
Thine efforts shortly shall be shown,
When all the vengeance thou canst wreak
Must fall upon - a nameless stone.
